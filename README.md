# CLUE (Constrained LUmping for differential Equations)

CLUE is a Python implementation of the algorithm from the paper ''CLUE: Exact maximal reduction of kinetic models by constrained lumping of differential equations'' (by A.Ovchinnikov, I. PÃ©rez Verona, G. Pogudin, M. Tribastone).

## What is constrained lumping?

Constrained lumping as type of exact order reduction for models defined by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with polynomial right-hand side.
We will explain it using a toy example. Consider the system

![$\begin{cases} \dot{x}_1  = x_2^2 + 4x_2x_3 + 4x_3^2,\\ \dot{x}_2  =  4x_3 - 2x_1,\\ \dot{x}_3  = x_1 + x_2 \end{cases}$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D%20%5Cdot%7Bx%7D_1%20%20%3D%20x_2%5E2%20%2B%204x_2x_3%20%2B%204x_3%5E2%2C%5C%5C%20%5Cdot%7Bx%7D_2%20%20%3D%20%204x_3%20-%202x_1%2C%5C%5C%20%5Cdot%7Bx%7D_3%20%20%3D%20x_1%20%2B%20x_2%20%5Cend%7Bcases%7D%24)

Assume that we are interested **only** in the dynamics of the variable ![$x_1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24x_1%24). An example of constrained lumping in this case would be the following set of new variables

![$y_1 = x_1 \quad \text{ and } y_2 = x_2 + 2x_3$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24y_1%20%3D%20x_1%20%5Cquad%20%5Ctext%7B%20and%20%7D%20y_2%20%3D%20x_2%20%2B%202x_3%24)

The crucial feature of these variables is their derivatives can be written in terms of ![$y_1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24y_1%24) and ![$y_2$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24y_2%24) only:

![$\dot{y}_1 = \dot{x}_1 = (x_2 + 2x_3)^2 = y_2^2,$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cdot%7By%7D_1%20%3D%20%5Cdot%7Bx%7D_1%20%3D%20(x_2%20%2B%202x_3)%5E2%20%3D%20y_2%5E2%2C%24)

![$\dot{y}_2 = \dot{x}_2 + 2\dot{x}_3 = 2x_2 + 4x_3 = 2y_2.$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cdot%7By%7D_2%20%3D%20%5Cdot%7Bx%7D_2%20%2B%202%5Cdot%7Bx%7D_3%20%3D%202x_2%20%2B%204x_3%20%3D%202y_2.%24)

Therefore, the original system can be **reduced exactly** to the following system while keeping the variable of interest:

![$\begin{cases} \dot{y}_1 = y_2^2,\\ \dot{y}_2 = 2y_2. \end{cases}$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D%20%5Cdot%7By%7D_1%20%3D%20y_2%5E2%2C%5C%5C%20%5Cdot%7By%7D_2%20%3D%202y_2.%20%5Cend%7Bcases%7D%24)

**In general,** constrained lumping is an exact model reduction by linear transformation that preserves a prescribed set of linear combinations of the unknown functions.
For precise definition and more details, we refer to Section 2 of the paper.

## What does CLUE do and how to use it?

For an interactive version of this minitutorial, see this jupyter notebook.

CLUE implements an algorithm that takes as **input**
* a system of ODEs with polynomial right-hand side
* a list of linear combinations of the unknown functions to be preserved (*observables*)

and **returns** the maximal exact reduction of the system by a linear transformation that preserves given combinations.

We will demonstrate the usage of CLUE on the example above. For more details on usage including reading models from \*.ode files, see tutorial ([jupyter](Tutorial.ipynb), [html](Tutorial.html))

1. import relevant functions from sympy and the function that does lumping:

```python
from sympy import vring, QQ
from clue import do_lumping
```

2. Introduce the variables ![$x_1, x_2, x_3$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24x_1%2C%20x_2%2C%20x_3%24) by defining the ring of polynomials in these variables (QQ refers to the fact that the coefficients are rational numbers, for other optons see the tutorial)

```python
R = vring(["x1", "x2", "x3"], QQ)
```

3. Construct a list of right-hand sides of the ODE. The right-hand sides must be in the same order as the variables on the definition of the ring

```python
ode = [
    x2**2 + 4 * x2 * x3 + 4 * x3**2, # derivative of x1
    4 * x3 - 2 * x1,                 # derivative of x2
    x1 + x2                          # derivative of x3
]
```

4. Call `do_lumping` providing the system and the combinations to preserve, that is, `[x1]`

```python
do_lumping(ode, [x1])
```

You will get the following result

```
New variables:
y0 = x1
y1 = x2 + 2*x3
Lumped system:
y0' = y1**2
y1' = 2*y1
```

which is the same as we have seen earlier.

## Large examples

Examples of reductions obtained over large systems appearing in the literature (including the ones discussed in the paper) are contained in the [examples](examples/) folder. For additional information, see [readme](examples/README.md).
