DESCRIPTION:
Simplified Cellular Model for Activation of Jak-Family Protein Tyrosine Kinases. The model includes GH ligand (L) and GH receptor (R) and also considers Jak2 species with Y1 dephosphorylated in the cytosol (dashed square). In this model, Jak2 binds constitutively to receptors, but binding of two Jak2 molecules in the same complex is required for Jak2 autophosphorylation.
