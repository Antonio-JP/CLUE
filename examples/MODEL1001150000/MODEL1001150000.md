DESCRIPTION:
Id: Pepke2010_Full_Ca2/CaM_mCaMKII. The nomenclature of the different Calmodulin forms in the model differs from the description in the article. The C and N terminal Ca2+ binding sites are described by the numbers at each species name, with the first entry indicating the number of Ca2+ ions bound to the C and the second the ones bound on the N terminal sites. In complexes with two CaM, the four numbers at the end indicate _C_N_C_N. For example:CaM1N2C in the article is CaM_2_1 in the model, CaM4 is CaM_2_2 and KCaMcomplex_0_1_1_2 stands for CaMKII bound to CaM1C and CaM2N1C.
