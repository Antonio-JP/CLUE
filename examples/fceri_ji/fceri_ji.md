DESCRIPTION:
Base model of early events in FceRI signaling consisting in  354 species and 3680 reactions specified by 24 rules (counting each bi-directional rule as two separate rules).  
Four molecule types are included in the base model: a bivalent ligand that binds receptor from two equivalent sites, a receptor that has a single ligand-binding site and a pair of phosphorylation sites β and γ, a Src-family protein tyrosine kinase called Lyn and a Syk protein tyrosine kinase.
