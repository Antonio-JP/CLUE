New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S8 + 2*S10 + 4*S19 + S20
y2 = S9 + -1/2*S19
y3 = S16 + S19
y4 = S21
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/10*y1 + 9/5*y2 + 9/10*y4, 11/10*y1 + 11/5*y2 + 11/10*y4)
y1' = (9/10*y3 + 9/5*y2 + 27/5*y4, 11/10*y3 + 11/5*y2 + 33/5*y4)
y2' = (9/10*y3 + 9/20*y4, 11/10*y3 + 11/20*y4)
y3' = (9/10*y4, 11/10*y4)
y4' = (0, 0)
