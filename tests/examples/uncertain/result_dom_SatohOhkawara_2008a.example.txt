New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 16*y1 + 17*y2 + 40*y3 + 17*y4 + 9*y5 + 11*y6 + 23*y7
y1' = 6*y0 + 10*y2 + 6*y3 + 7*y4 + 7*y5 + 8*y6 + 6*y7
y2' = 5*y0 + 3*y1 + 3*y3 + 6*y4 + 2*y5 + 4*y6 + 3*y7
y3' = 5*y0 + 2*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y4 + 2*y5 + 2*y6 + 4*y7
y4' = 2*y0 + y2 + 3*y3 + y5 + y6
y5' = y2 + y3
y6' = y4
y7' = y2
