New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + S2
y2 = S3
y3 = S4 + 2*S6 + S10
y4 = S5
y5 = S7
y6 = S8
y7 = S9
y8 = S11
Lumped system:
y0' = y7
y1' = 6*y2 + 6*y4 + 4*y5 + 4*y7 + 2*y1
y2' = 3*y1 + 2*y4 + 3*y5 + 3*y7
y3' = 6*y7
y4' = 3*y1 + 2*y2 + 2*y5 + 2*y7
y5' = 2*y1 + 3*y2 + 2*y4 + 2*y7
y6' = y7 + y8
y7' = y0 + 2*y1 + 3*y2 + y3 + 2*y4 + 2*y5 + y6 + 3*y8
y8' = y6 + 3*y7
