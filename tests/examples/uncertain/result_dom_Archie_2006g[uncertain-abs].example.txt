New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3 + S4
y4 = S6
y5 = S7
y6 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = (3999/4000*y1 + 3999/4000*y2 + 3999/4000*y3 + 11999/4000*y4, 4001/4000*y1 + 4001/4000*y2 + 4001/4000*y3 + 12001/4000*y4)
y1' = (3999/4000*y2 + 11999/4000*y5, 4001/4000*y2 + 12001/4000*y5)
y2' = (3999/4000*y6, 4001/4000*y6)
y3' = (3999/4000*y1 + 5999/2000*y6 + 3999/4000*y4, 4001/4000*y1 + 6001/2000*y6 + 4001/4000*y4)
y4' = (3999/4000*y6, 4001/4000*y6)
y5' = (3999/4000*y1, 4001/4000*y1)
y6' = (0, 0)
