===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2 + -1/5*S4
y3 = S3 + 1/5*S4
y4 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 23*y1 + 85*y3 + 38*y4
y1' = y2 + y3
y2' = 13/5*y1 + -2/5*y2 + -2/5*y3 + -4/5*y4
y3' = 19/5*y4 + 2/5*y1 + 2/5*y2 + 2/5*y3
y4' = 0
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 5
