Lumped system:
y0' = 2*y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + 2*y7 + y8 + 2*y9 + y11 + 2*y14
y1' = 2*y2 + y3 + y9 + y11 + y14
y2' = y3 + y4 + y5 + y8 + y9 + y11
y3' = y2 + 2*y4 + y5 + y11
y4' = y0 + y1 + y5 + y10 + y11 + y12 + y13 + 2*y14
y5' = y2 + y6 + y7 + y8 + 3*y11 + y14
y6' = 3*y3 + y11 + y14
y7' = y10
y8' = 2*y12 + y14
y9' = 5*y12 + y13
y10' = y11 + y12 + 2*y13
y11' = y2 + y3 + y10 + 12*y12 + y13 + y14
y12' = y5 + y10 + y11 + y14
y13' = 0
y14' = y8 + y11
