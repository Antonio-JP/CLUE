New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = 3*y1 + y2 + 3*y4 + 7*y6
y1' = 6*y2 + 6*y3 + 2*y4 + 19*y5 + 43*y6
y2' = 2*y3 + 6*y4 + 19*y5 + 56*y6
y3' = 13*y5 + 45*y6
y4' = y0 + 27*y5 + 72*y6
y5' = y1 + y2 + y3 + 4*y6
y6' = 4*y2 + y5
The size of the original model is 7
The size of the reduced model is 7
