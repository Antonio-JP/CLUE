New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + -128/15*S5
y2 = S2
y3 = S3 + 9/10*S5
y4 = S4
y5 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = (27/10*y1 + 423/10*y2 + 153/5*y3 + 279/10*y4 + 9*y5, 33/10*y1 + 517/10*y2 + 187/5*y3 + 341/10*y4 + 11*y5)
y1' = (9/2*y2 + 9*y3 + 9/5*y4, 11/2*y2 + 11*y3 + 11/5*y4)
y2' = (63*y3 + 189/5*y4, 77*y3 + 231/5*y4)
y3' = (117/5*y4 + 9/5*y5, 143/5*y4 + 11/5*y5)
y4' = (117/10*y5, 143/10*y5)
y5' = (0, 0)
