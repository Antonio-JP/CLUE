New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = 10*y1 + 19*y2 + 4*y3 + 24*y4 + 10*y5 + 12*y6
y1' = 3*y0 + 7*y4 + 5*y5 + 6*y6
y2' = 3*y0 + 7*y1 + 15*y3 + 18*y4 + 14*y5 + 28*y6
y3' = y5
y4' = 6*y3 + 2*y6
y5' = y2 + 7*y3 + 4*y4 + 23*y6
y6' = 3*y0 + 3*y2 + 12*y3 + 23*y4
The size of the original model is 7
The size of the reduced model is 7
