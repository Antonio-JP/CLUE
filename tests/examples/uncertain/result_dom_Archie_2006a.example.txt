New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + 2/5*S5 + -53/75*S7
y2 = S2 + -2/3*S5 + 209/225*S7
y3 = S3 + 1/3*S5 + 14/9*S7
y4 = S4 + S5 + -8/3*S7
y5 = S6 + S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 5*y1 + 5*y2 + 4*y3 + 2*y4
y1' = 5*y2 + y3 + 3*y4 + 11/5*y5
y2' = 3*y3 + 2*y4 + y5
y3' = y4 + 3*y5
y4' = 8*y5
y5' = 0
The size of the original model is 8
The size of the reduced model is 6
