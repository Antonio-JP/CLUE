New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + S3
y2 = S2
y3 = S4 + S10
y4 = S5
y5 = S6
y6 = S7
y7 = S8
y8 = S9
y9 = S11
Lumped system:
y0' = y6 + y5 + y8
y1' = 2*y4 + 2*y5 + y1
y2' = 12*y4 + 5*y6 + y9 + y3 + 3*y5 + y7
y3' = 2*y2 + 2*y5 + 2*y6 + 2*y4 + 2*y3
y4' = y1 + 12*y2 + y3 + y9 + 2*y5 + y8
y5' = y0 + y1 + 3*y2 + y3 + 2*y4 + 10*y6
y6' = y0 + 5*y2 + y3 + 10*y5 + y8
y7' = y2
y8' = y0 + y4 + y6
y9' = y2 + y4
