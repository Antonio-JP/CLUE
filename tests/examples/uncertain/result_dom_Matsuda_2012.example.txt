New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + -1/2*S4 + 1/2*S5 + 21/4*S8 + -1/2*S9
y2 = S2 + 2/3*S4 + -13/2*S8 + 1/3*S9
y3 = S3 + 4*S4 + -2*S5 + -88/3*S8 + 2*S9
y4 = S6 + 5*S8
y5 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 2*y1 + 3*y2 + 2*y4
y1' = 3*y2 + 4*y4
y2' = 4*y1 + y3 + 2*y4 + 3*y5
y3' = y4 + y5
y4' = y5
y5' = 0
The size of the original model is 10
