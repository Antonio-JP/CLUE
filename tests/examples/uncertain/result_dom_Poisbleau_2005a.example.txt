New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 5*y1 + 11*y2 + 7*y3 + 4*y4 + 15*y5 + 15*y6 + 12*y7
y1' = 12*y2 + 9*y3 + 8*y4 + 49*y5 + 29*y6 + 31*y7
y2' = y0 + 11*y3 + 30*y4 + 35*y5 + 30*y6 + 15*y7
y3' = y4 + 4*y5 + 6*y6 + 2*y7
y4' = 5*y5 + 4*y6
y5' = 50*y6 + 23*y7
y6' = 2*y3 + 15*y7
y7' = 9*y5 + 5*y6
The size of the original model is 8
