New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 22*y1 + 20*y2 + y3 + 29*y4 + 29*y5 + 13*y6
y1' = 17*y2 + y3 + y4 + 6*y6 + y7
y2' = y1 + 4*y4
y3' = y1 + y6
y4' = 4*y1 + y2 + y3 + 11*y5 + 17*y6
y5' = 7*y1 + 2*y2 + 15*y4 + 28*y6
y6' = 7*y2 + 3*y4 + 2*y5
y7' = 0
The size of the original model is 8
