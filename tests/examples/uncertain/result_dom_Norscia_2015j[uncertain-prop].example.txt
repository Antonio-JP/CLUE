===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S2 + 2*S5 + S10
y2 = S6
y3 = S7 + 2*S8 + 2*S10
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/5*y2 + 9/10*y3, 11/5*y2 + 11/10*y3)
y1' = (27/5*y2 + 9/10*y3, 33/5*y2 + 11/10*y3)
y2' = (0, 0)
y3' = (9/10*y1 + 9/10*y2, 11/10*y1 + 11/10*y2)
The size of the original model is 11
