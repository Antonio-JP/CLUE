y1 = S2
y2 = S3 + S9 + 20*S10 + 2*S11
y3 = S4
y4 = S5 + -39*S10 + -4*S11
y5 = S6 + 5*S10
y6 = S7
y7 = S8 + -5*S10
y8 = S12
Lumped system:
y0' = 6*y1 + 2*y2 + 8*y3 + y4 + 2*y5 + y6 + 2*y7
y1' = y2 + 9*y3 + 2*y5 + y6 + 6*y7
y2' = 4*y3 + 40*y8
y3' = y5 + 8*y8
y4' = 4*y0 + y5 + y7 + -78*y8
y5' = y6 + 10*y8
y6' = y1
y7' = -10*y8
