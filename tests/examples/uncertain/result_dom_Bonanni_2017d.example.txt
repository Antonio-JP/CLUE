New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 21*y1 + 71*y2 + 187*y3 + 35*y4 + 7*y5 + 5*y6 + 18*y7
y1' = 15*y2 + 9*y3 + 8*y4 + y6 + 93*y7
y2' = y3 + 2*y4 + y5 + 4*y6 + 29*y7
y3' = y1 + 20*y4 + 4*y5 + 8*y6 + 58*y7
y4' = y5 + 30*y6 + 7*y7
y5' = y2 + y4
y6' = 2*y7
y7' = 2*y6
The size of the original model is 8
