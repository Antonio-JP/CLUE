===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S6 + S7 + 1/2*S11
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/5*y1, 11/5*y1)
y1' = (81/20*y0, 99/20*y0)
The size of the original model is 16
The size of the reduced model is 2

Is the lumping a Forward Lumping (FL)?: False
Has the lumping a Robust Weighted Lumping (RWL)?: True
