New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 8*y1 + 17*y2 + 16*y3 + 4*y4 + 8*y5 + 24*y6 + 5*y7
y1' = 28*y2 + 13*y3 + 12*y4 + 9*y5 + 5*y6 + y7
y2' = 48*y3 + 15*y4 + 15*y5 + 7*y6 + 3*y7
y3' = 13*y4 + 8*y5 + 4*y6 + 9*y7
y4' = 12*y5 + 9*y6 + 2*y7
y5' = 8*y6
y6' = 5*y7
y7' = y3 + y4 + y5 + y6
The size of the original model is 8
