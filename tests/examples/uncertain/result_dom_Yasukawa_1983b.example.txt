===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 29*y1 + 26*y2 + 187*y3 + 32*y4 + 55*y5
y1' = 14*y0 + 10*y2 + 14*y3 + 18*y4 + 38*y5
y2' = 22*y3 + 7*y4 + 22*y5
y3' = 9*y0 + 4*y1 + 3*y2 + 7*y4 + 5*y5
y4' = 4*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3 + 23*y5
y5' = 2*y0 + 3*y2 + y3 + y4
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
