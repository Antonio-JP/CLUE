New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + -3/4*S4
y2 = S2 + 1/4*S4
y3 = S3
y4 = S5
y5 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/5*y1 + 27/5*y2 + 9/5*y3, 11/5*y1 + 33/5*y2 + 11/5*y3)
y1' = (36/5*y2 + 9/10*y3 + -27/8*y4 + -81/40*y5, 44/5*y2 + 11/10*y3 + -33/8*y4 + -99/40*y5)
y2' = (9/5*y3 + 81/40*y4 + 27/40*y5, 11/5*y3 + 99/40*y4 + 33/40*y5)
y3' = (9/5*y4, 11/5*y4)
y4' = (9/10*y5, 11/10*y5)
y5' = (0, 0)
