New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 2*y1 + 4*y3 + y4 + y5 + 6*y6 + y7
y1' = y0 + 5*y2 + y4 + y5 + y7
y2' = y1 + 2*y3 + 3*y4 + y5 + 2*y7
y3' = 2*y2 + 3*y4 + 2*y5 + 2*y6 + 3*y7
y4' = y2 + 2*y5 + y6 + 3*y7
y5' = y1 + 2*y6 + 5*y7
y6' = y1 + y7
y7' = y2
The size of the original model is 8
The size of the reduced model is 8
