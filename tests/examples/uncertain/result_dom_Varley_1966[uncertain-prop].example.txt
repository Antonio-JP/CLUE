===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + 1/7*S4 + -1/112*S5
y2 = S2 + 3/31*S4 + 20/31*S5
y3 = S3 + 6/7*S4 + 4/7*S5
Lumped system:
y0' = (72/5*y1 + 279/10*y2 + 81/10*y3, 88/5*y1 + 341/10*y2 + 99/10*y3)
y1' = (279/10*y2 + 63/10*y3, 341/10*y2 + 77/10*y3)
y2' = (63/10*y3, 77/10*y3)
y3' = (0, 0)
