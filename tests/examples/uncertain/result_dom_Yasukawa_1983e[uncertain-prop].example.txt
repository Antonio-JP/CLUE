New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = (27/2*y1 + 81/10*y2 + 27/5*y3 + 81/10*y4 + 27/10*y5, 33/2*y1 + 99/10*y2 + 33/5*y3 + 99/10*y4 + 33/10*y5)
y1' = (9*y2 + 81/10*y3 + 72/5*y4 + 36/5*y5, 11*y2 + 99/10*y3 + 88/5*y4 + 44/5*y5)
y2' = (9*y3 + 63/10*y4 + 9/2*y5, 11*y3 + 77/10*y4 + 11/2*y5)
y3' = (9/5*y2 + 171/10*y4 + 18/5*y5, 11/5*y2 + 209/10*y4 + 22/5*y5)
y4' = (9/10*y1 + 27/5*y5, 11/10*y1 + 33/5*y5)
y5' = (9/10*y4, 11/10*y4)
