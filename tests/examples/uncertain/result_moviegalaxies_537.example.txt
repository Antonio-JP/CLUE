New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2 + 2*S11
y3 = S3
y4 = S4 + -2*S11
y5 = S5 + S11
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
y9 = S9 + S10
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + y3 + 2*y6
y1' = y0 + 3*y8 + y9 + y2 + y3 + y4 + y7
y2' = y1 + 5*y6 + 2*y7
y3' = y0 + y1 + 4*y8 + 4*y6 + y7
y4' = y1 + -4*y6 + -2*y7
y5' = 2*y7 + 2*y6
y6' = 2*y0 + y2 + 4*y3 + y8
y7' = y1 + y3 + y5 + y8
y8' = 3*y1 + 4*y3 + y6 + y7
y9' = 2*y1 + 2*y9
The size of the original model is 12
