New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + y3 + 2*y5 + y2 + y4 + 2*y6 + y8
y1' = y0 + 7*y6 + y7 + 2*y8 + 6*y4
y2' = y0 + y6 + y5 + y8
y3' = y0 + y5 + y7 + y8
y4' = y0 + 6*y1 + 5*y6 + 6*y8
y5' = 2*y0 + y2 + y3 + y6 + y8
y6' = 2*y0 + 7*y1 + y2 + 5*y4 + y5 + 2*y7 + 12*y8
y7' = y1 + y3 + 2*y6 + y8
y8' = y0 + 2*y1 + y2 + y3 + 6*y4 + y5 + 12*y6 + y7
