New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3 + S10 + S12 + 5*S13
y4 = S4
y5 = S5 + S14
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
y9 = S9
y10 = S11
Lumped system:
y0' = 2*y1 + y9 + 3*y7
y1' = 2*y0 + y4 + 3*y7 + y9 + y6
y2' = y4 + 2*y7 + y8
y3' = 28*y7
y4' = y1 + y2 + 7*y7 + y6 + y9 + y10
y5' = 2*y6 + 2*y7
y6' = y1 + y4 + y5 + 4*y7
y7' = 3*y0 + 3*y1 + 2*y2 + y3 + 7*y4 + y5 + 4*y6 + 2*y9 + y8 + y10
y8' = y2 + y7
y9' = y0 + y1 + y4 + 2*y7
y10' = y4 + y7
