New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + S8
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S9
y7 = S11
y8 = S12
y9 = S14
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + y2 + y3 + y6 + y7
y1' = 2*y0 + 2*y2 + 2*y7 + y1
y2' = y0 + y1 + 3*y4 + 3*y5 + y6 + y7
y3' = y0
y4' = 3*y2 + 3*y5 + y9
y5' = 3*y2 + 3*y4 + 2*y9
y6' = y0 + y2
y7' = y0 + y1 + y2 + 3*y8
y8' = 3*y7
y9' = y4 + 2*y5
