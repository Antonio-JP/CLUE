===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + y2 + y3 + 2*y4 + y5
y1' = y0 + 34*y2 + 21*y3 + 25*y4 + 3*y5
y2' = 5*y1 + 16*y3 + 17*y4 + 5*y5
y3' = y0 + 3*y2 + 20*y4 + 7*y5
y4' = 3*y2 + 13*y3 + y5
y5' = 2*y2 + 2*y3
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
