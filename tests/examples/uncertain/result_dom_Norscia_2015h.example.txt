New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6 + -1/2*S9
y7 = S7 + 1/4*S9
Lumped system:
y0' = y2 + 5*y3 + 5*y4 + 5*y5 + 2*y6 + 8*y7
y1' = 6*y0 + y3 + y4 + 14*y5
y2' = 0
y3' = y1
y4' = 2*y0 + 4*y5 + y6 + 2*y7
y5' = y0 + y2 + 4*y3
y6' = y2
y7' = y2 + 4*y5
The size of the original model is 10
The size of the reduced model is 8
