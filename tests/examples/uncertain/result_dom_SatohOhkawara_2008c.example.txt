New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2 + S7
y3 = S3
y4 = S4 + -9/28*S6 + 23/14*S7 + 23/14*S9
y5 = S5 + 9/7*S6 + -4/7*S7 + 3/7*S9
y6 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = 11*y1 + 6*y3 + 4*y4 + 8*y5 + 11*y6
y1' = 7*y0 + 8*y3 + 4*y4 + y5 + y6
y2' = 2*y1 + 2*y3
y3' = y2
y4' = y3
y5' = y6
y6' = 0
The size of the original model is 10
