New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = (189/5*y1 + 189/10*y2 + 72/5*y3 + 18*y4 + 333/10*y5, 231/5*y1 + 231/10*y2 + 88/5*y3 + 22*y4 + 407/10*y5)
y1' = (441/10*y2 + 108/5*y3 + 99/5*y4 + 108/5*y5, 539/10*y2 + 132/5*y3 + 121/5*y4 + 132/5*y5)
y2' = (27/2*y1 + 171/2*y3 + 279/10*y4 + 369/5*y5, 33/2*y1 + 209/2*y3 + 341/10*y4 + 451/5*y5)
y3' = (0, 0)
y4' = (18/5*y2, 22/5*y2)
y5' = (9/2*y4, 11/2*y4)
