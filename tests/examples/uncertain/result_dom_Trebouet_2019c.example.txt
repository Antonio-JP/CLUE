New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = 19*y1 + 12*y2 + 22*y3 + 2*y4 + y6 + 2*y7 + 2*y8
y1' = 14*y2 + 9*y3 + y4 + 4*y5 + 2*y6 + 2*y7 + 3*y8
y2' = 14*y3 + y4 + y6 + 2*y7 + 2*y8
y3' = 8*y4 + 2*y6 + y7 + y8
y4' = 2*y5 + 2*y6 + 3*y7 + 2*y8
y5' = y6 + y7 + y8
y6' = 2*y7 + y8
y7' = 2*y8
y8' = 0
