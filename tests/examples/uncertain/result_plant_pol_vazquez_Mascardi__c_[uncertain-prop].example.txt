===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
Lumped system:
y0' = (657/10*y1, 803/10*y1)
y1' = (657/10*y0, 803/10*y0)
The size of the original model is 144
The size of the reduced model is 2

Is the lumping a Forward Lumping (FL)?: True
Has the lumping a Robust Weighted Lumping (RWL)?: True
