New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S3 + 1/8*S4
y2 = S5
y3 = S6
y4 = S7
y5 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = (36/5*y1 + 9/5*y2 + 9/10*y3 + 27/10*y4 + 9/10*y5, 44/5*y1 + 11/5*y2 + 11/10*y3 + 33/10*y4 + 11/10*y5)
y1' = (9/2*y2 + 27/5*y3 + 9/5*y5, 11/2*y2 + 33/5*y3 + 11/5*y5)
y2' = (9/5*y3 + 9/5*y4 + 27/10*y5, 11/5*y3 + 11/5*y4 + 33/10*y5)
y3' = (9/10*y4 + 72/5*y5, 11/10*y4 + 88/5*y5)
y4' = (9/10*y5, 11/10*y5)
y5' = (0, 0)
