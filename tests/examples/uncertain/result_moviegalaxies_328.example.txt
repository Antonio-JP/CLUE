New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + 2*y2 + 16*y3 + y4 + y7 + y8 + 15*y5
y1' = y0 + y3 + y5
y2' = 2*y0 + y3 + y4 + 2*y5 + y6
y3' = 16*y0 + y1 + y2 + 3*y4 + y7 + 2*y8 + 18*y5
y4' = y0 + y2 + 3*y3 + 4*y5
y5' = 15*y0 + y1 + 2*y2 + 18*y3 + 4*y4 + y7 + y8
y6' = y2
y7' = y0 + y3 + y5 + y8
y8' = y0 + 2*y3 + y5 + y7
