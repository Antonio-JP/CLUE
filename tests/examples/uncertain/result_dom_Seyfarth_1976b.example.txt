New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 10*y1 + 3*y2 + 18*y3 + 10*y4 + 9*y5 + 10*y6 + 3*y7
y1' = y2 + 11*y3 + 9*y5 + 2*y6
y2' = 4*y3 + 12*y4 + y5 + 3*y6 + 6*y7
y3' = y2 + 3*y4 + 6*y6 + 2*y7
y4' = 2*y3 + y5 + 3*y6 + y7
y5' = 3*y6 + y7
y6' = y3 + 4*y7
y7' = 0
The size of the original model is 8
