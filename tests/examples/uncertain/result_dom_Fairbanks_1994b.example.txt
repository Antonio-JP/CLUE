New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S2
y2 = S3
y3 = S4
y4 = S5
y5 = S6
y6 = S7
y7 = S8
y8 = S9
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + y2
y1' = y2 + y3 + 3*y4 + 5*y5 + 9*y6 + 2*y8
y2' = y4 + 3*y5 + y7 + 4*y8
y3' = y5
y4' = 3*y6
y5' = y2 + 5*y6 + 2*y7 + 4*y8
y6' = 2*y1 + 2*y5 + 3*y8
y7' = 0
y8' = y2
The size of the original model is 10
