New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = (11999/4000*y1 + 7999/4000*y2 + 19999/4000*y3, 12001/4000*y1 + 8001/4000*y2 + 20001/4000*y3)
y1' = (3999/4000*y2 + 11999/4000*y3 + 7999/4000*y5, 4001/4000*y2 + 12001/4000*y3 + 8001/4000*y5)
y2' = (7999/4000*y3 + 11999/4000*y4 + 7999/4000*y5, 8001/4000*y3 + 12001/4000*y4 + 8001/4000*y5)
y3' = (19999/4000*y4, 20001/4000*y4)
y4' = (11999/4000*y5, 12001/4000*y5)
y5' = (0, 0)
