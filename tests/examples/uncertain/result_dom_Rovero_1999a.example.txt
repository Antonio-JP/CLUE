New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + -11/2*S7
y2 = S2 + -1/4*S7
y3 = S3 + 1/2*S7
y4 = S4 + 1/2*S7
y5 = S5 + 3/4*S7
y6 = S6 + 5/2*S7
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + 6*y2 + 6*y3 + 2*y4 + 4*y5
y1' = y2 + y4 + y5
y2' = y1 + 2*y3 + 3*y4 + 2*y5 + y6
y3' = 2*y2 + 4*y4 + 2*y5
y4' = 2*y2 + y6
y5' = 2*y2 + y3
y6' = 0
The size of the original model is 8
The size of the reduced model is 7
