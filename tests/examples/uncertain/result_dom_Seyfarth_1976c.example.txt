New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + 11/5*S2 + 921/515*S5 + -1588/515*S6
y2 = S3 + 21/103*S5 + -4/103*S6
y3 = S4 + 2*S6
y4 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 5*y1 + 15*y2 + 14*y3 + 6*y4
y1' = 103/5*y2 + 26/5*y3 + 6646/515*y4
y2' = y3 + 944/103*y4
y3' = 3*y4
y4' = 0
The size of the original model is 8
The size of the reduced model is 5
