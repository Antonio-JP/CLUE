New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
y9 = S10
Lumped system:
y0' = 2*y1 + 5*y2 + 4*y3 + y4 + 5*y5 + 2*y8 + y9
y1' = y0 + 3*y2 + 3*y3 + y4 + 2*y5 + y6 + y7
y2' = y0 + y1 + 6*y3 + y4 + y6
y3' = 3*y2 + y4 + y7 + y9
y4' = y2 + y3 + y5
y5' = y1 + y2 + y4 + 11*y6 + 3*y7
y6' = y1 + y3 + y9
y7' = 3*y1 + y2 + y4 + 2*y6 + y9
y8' = y2 + y3
y9' = y2 + 3*y3 + 2*y8
The size of the original model is 11
The size of the reduced model is 10
