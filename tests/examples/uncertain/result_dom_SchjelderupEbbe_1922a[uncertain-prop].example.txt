New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + S2 + S3
y2 = S4
y3 = S5
y4 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/10*y1 + 9/10*y2 + 9/10*y3 + 9/10*y4, 11/10*y1 + 11/10*y2 + 11/10*y3 + 11/10*y4)
y1' = (27/10*y2 + 27/10*y3 + 27/10*y4 + 9/10*y1, 33/10*y2 + 33/10*y3 + 33/10*y4 + 11/10*y1)
y2' = (9/10*y3 + 9/10*y4, 11/10*y3 + 11/10*y4)
y3' = (9/10*y4, 11/10*y4)
y4' = (0, 0)
