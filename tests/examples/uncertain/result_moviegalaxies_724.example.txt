New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
y9 = S9
Lumped system:
y0' = 5*y1 + 8*y3 + 5*y5 + y9 + y2 + 2*y4 + 8*y6
y1' = 5*y0 + y3 + 5*y6 + y2 + 2*y4 + 3*y5
y2' = y0 + y1 + y6 + y4
y3' = 8*y0 + y1 + y5 + 2*y6
y4' = 2*y0 + 2*y1 + y2 + y6 + y8 + y9
y5' = 5*y0 + 3*y1 + y3 + 3*y6 + y7 + y9
y6' = 8*y0 + 5*y1 + y2 + 2*y3 + y4 + 3*y5 + y8 + y9
y7' = y5
y8' = y4 + y6 + y9
y9' = y0 + y4 + y5 + y6 + y8
