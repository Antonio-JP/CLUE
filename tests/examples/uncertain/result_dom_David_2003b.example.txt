New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + -2/3*S3 + -2/3*S4 + -S6
y2 = S2 + 2/3*S3 + 5/3*S4 + S6 + -31/21*S7
y3 = S5 + 38/7*S7
y4 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = 3*y1 + 3*y2 + y3
y1' = 3*y2 + -y4 + -4/3*y3
y2' = y0 + 7/3*y3 + 1/21*y4
y3' = 76/7*y4
y4' = 0
The size of the original model is 9
The size of the reduced model is 5
