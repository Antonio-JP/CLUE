New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3 + 1/3*S4
y4 = S5
y5 = S6
y6 = S7
y7 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = 8*y1 + 3*y2 + 5*y4 + 6*y5 + 9*y6 + 11*y7
y1' = 7*y0 + 6*y3 + 5*y4 + 43*y5 + 15*y6 + 16*y7
y2' = y1 + 5*y4 + 8*y5 + y6 + y7
y3' = y0 + 2*y1 + 10/3*y5 + 7/3*y7 + y6
y4' = y1 + 4*y5 + y6
y5' = y2 + 7*y4 + 5*y6 + 3*y7
y6' = 7*y5 + 2*y7
y7' = y5 + y6
The size of the original model is 9
The size of the reduced model is 8
