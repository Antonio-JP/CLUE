New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + S2 + S11
y2 = S3
y3 = S4
y4 = S5 + -2*S10
y5 = S6
y6 = S7 + S8 + 1/2*S9 + 3/2*S10
y7 = S12
Lumped system:
y0' = y5
y1' = 3*y2 + 3*y5 + 2*y1
y2' = y1 + 2*y6 + 43*y5
y3' = 4*y5 + 4*y7
y4' = -y5 + -6*y2
y5' = y0 + y1 + 43*y2 + 4*y3 + y4 + 2*y6 + 7*y7
y6' = 9*y2 + 6*y5
y7' = 4*y3 + 7*y5
The size of the original model is 13
