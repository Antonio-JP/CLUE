New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2 + S7
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S8
y8 = S9
Lumped system:
y0' = y4 + y5 + y7
y1' = y4 + 2*y5 + y6
y2' = 2*y4 + 2*y5 + y2
y3' = y4
y4' = y0 + y1 + y2 + y3 + y7 + y8 + 19*y5 + y6
y5' = y0 + 2*y1 + y2 + 19*y4 + y7 + y8 + y6
y6' = y1 + y4 + y5
y7' = y0 + y4 + y5
y8' = y4 + y5
The size of the original model is 10
