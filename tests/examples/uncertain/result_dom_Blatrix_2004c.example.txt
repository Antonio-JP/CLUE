New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + 430/2561*S11
y2 = S2 + 3259/2561*S11
y3 = S3 + -6/13*S11
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6 + -26040/2561*S11
y7 = S7 + 10*S11
y8 = S8
y9 = S10 + 38845/2561*S11
Lumped system:
y0' = 5*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3 + 2*y4 + 2*y5
y1' = 39*y2 + 40*y3 + 18*y4 + y5 + y6
y2' = 26*y3 + 19*y4 + y5 + 3*y7 + y8
y3' = 13*y4 + y5 + y7 + y8
y4' = 2*y5 + y6 + y8 + y9
y5' = y1 + y6 + y7 + 2*y8
y6' = y5
y7' = y8
y8' = y4
