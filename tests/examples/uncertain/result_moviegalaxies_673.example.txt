New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + -4/5*S10
y2 = S2 + S11
y3 = S3 + -1/5*S10
y4 = S4 + 6/5*S10
y5 = S5 + 4/5*S10
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8 + 2*S9
Lumped system:
y0' = 2*y6
y1' = y5 + -4/5*y3 + -4/5*y4 + -56/5*y6 + -24/5*y7
y2' = 2*y6 + 2*y7
y3' = 4/5*y4 + -1/5*y3 + -14/5*y6 + -6/5*y7
y4' = 11/5*y3 + 61/5*y7 + 129/5*y6 + 6/5*y4
y5' = y1 + 76/5*y6 + 4/5*y3 + 4/5*y4 + 24/5*y7
y6' = 2*y0 + y2 + 9*y4 + 4*y5 + 28*y7 + y8
y7' = y2 + 5*y4 + 28*y6
y8' = 5*y6
