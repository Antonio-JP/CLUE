New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 41*y1 + 22*y2 + 2*y3 + 34*y4 + 5*y5 + 6*y6 + 15*y7
y1' = 28*y0 + 7*y2 + 8*y4 + 2*y5 + 25*y7
y2' = y0 + y1 + 9*y3 + 6*y4 + y5 + 3*y6 + 12*y7
y3' = y0 + y1 + y2 + 3*y4 + y5 + y6
y4' = 4*y1 + 10*y2 + 12*y3 + y5 + 3*y6 + 6*y7
y5' = y2 + 2*y4 + y6
y6' = y1 + 15*y4 + y7
y7' = 5*y2 + y3 + y4
