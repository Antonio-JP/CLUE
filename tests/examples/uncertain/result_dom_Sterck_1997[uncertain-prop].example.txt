New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S2 + 1/3*S5 + 1/3*S8
y2 = S3 + 4/3*S8
y3 = S4
y4 = S6
y5 = S7 + 2/3*S8
Lumped system:
y0' = (27/10*y1 + 9/10*y2 + 9/10*y3 + 9/10*y4 + 9/10*y5, 33/10*y1 + 11/10*y2 + 11/10*y3 + 11/10*y4 + 11/10*y5)
y1' = (9/10*y2 + 3*y3, 11/10*y2 + 11/3*y3)
y2' = (3*y3 + 9/10*y4 + 27/10*y5, 11/3*y3 + 11/10*y4 + 33/10*y5)
y3' = (9/10*y4, 11/10*y4)
y4' = (0, 0)
y5' = (3/5*y3, 11/15*y3)
