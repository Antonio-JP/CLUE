===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 119*y1 + 91*y2 + 39*y3 + 63*y4 + 8*y5
y1' = 9*y2 + 8*y3 + 3*y4 + y5
y2' = 3*y1 + 6*y3 + y4 + 5*y5
y3' = 10*y1 + y2 + y5
y4' = 18*y1 + 29*y2 + 11*y3 + 3*y5
y5' = 2*y2
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
