===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S2 + -S9
y2 = S4 + -1/4*S9
y3 = S6 + 1/8*S9
y4 = S8 + 13/8*S9
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/10*y1 + 27/10*y2 + 9/10*y3 + 9/10*y4, 11/10*y1 + 33/10*y2 + 11/10*y3 + 11/10*y4)
y1' = (9/5*y2 + 9/5*y3 + 9/5*y4, 11/5*y2 + 11/5*y3 + 11/5*y4)
y2' = (36/5*y3, 44/5*y3)
y3' = (9/10*y2 + 9/5*y4, 11/10*y2 + 11/5*y4)
y4' = (0, 0)
