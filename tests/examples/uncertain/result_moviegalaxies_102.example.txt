New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + 1/2*S7 + 1/2*S8 + 1/2*S14
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5 + 3/2*S7 + -1/2*S8 + S12 + 5/2*S14 + S17
y6 = S6
y7 = S9 + 2*S15
y8 = S10
y9 = S11
y10 = S13
y11 = S16
Lumped system:
y0' = y10 + y9
y1' = 7/2*y8 + 7/2*y9
y2' = y3 + y9
y3' = y2 + 2*y8 + 5*y9
y4' = y6 + y11 + y9
y5' = 27/2*y9 + 7/2*y8
y6' = y4 + y7 + y11 + 4*y9
y7' = 5*y6 + 5*y9
y8' = 2*y1 + 2*y3 + 20*y9
y9' = y0 + y1 + y2 + 5*y3 + y4 + y5 + 4*y6 + y7 + 20*y8 + y10 + 2*y11
y10' = y0 + y9
y11' = y4 + y6 + 2*y9
