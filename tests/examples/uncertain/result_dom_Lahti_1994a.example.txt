===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 53*y1 + 9*y2 + 33*y3 + 25*y4 + 33*y5
y1' = 18*y2 + 13*y3 + 55*y4 + 97*y5
y2' = 16*y3 + 15*y4 + 14*y5
y3' = 39*y1 + 15*y4 + 24*y5
y4' = 2*y3 + 33*y5
y5' = y1
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
