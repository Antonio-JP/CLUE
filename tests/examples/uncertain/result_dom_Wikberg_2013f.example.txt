New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
y9 = S9
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + 3*y2 + 2*y4 + y5 + 3*y7 + y9
y1' = 2*y2 + 4*y4 + y5 + y6 + 2*y7 + 3*y8 + 6*y9
y2' = y3 + y5 + y7 + y8 + y9
y3' = y4 + 2*y5 + y8
y4' = y1 + y5 + y6 + y7
y5' = y6
y6' = y7 + y9
y7' = y1 + y3 + y5 + 2*y8 + y9
y8' = y5
y9' = 0
The size of the original model is 10
