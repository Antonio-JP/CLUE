New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + S3
y2 = S2
y3 = S4
y4 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = (3999/4000*y1 + 15999/4000*y2, 4001/4000*y1 + 16001/4000*y2)
y1' = (31999/4000*y2 + 3999/4000*y3 + 13999/2000*y4, 32001/4000*y2 + 4001/4000*y3 + 14001/2000*y4)
y2' = (47999/4000*y3 + 71999/4000*y4, 48001/4000*y3 + 72001/4000*y4)
y3' = (3999/4000*y4, 4001/4000*y4)
y4' = (0, 0)
