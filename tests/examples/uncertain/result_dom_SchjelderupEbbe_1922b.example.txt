y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8

Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + y3 + y4 + y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9
y1' = y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9
y2' = y0 + y3 + y4 + y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9
y3' = y4 + y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9
y4' = y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9
y5' = y6 + y7 + y8 + y9
y6' = y7 + y8 + y9
y7' = y8 + y9
y8' = y9
