New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = 10*y1 + 13*y2 + 5*y3 + 6*y4 + 3*y5 + y6
y1' = 10*y2 + 7*y3 + y4 + y5 + 9*y6
y2' = 10*y3 + 6*y4 + 12*y5 + 2*y6
y3' = y4 + 2*y5
y4' = y3 + 4*y5 + 7*y6
y5' = 2*y6
y6' = 0
The size of the original model is 7
The size of the reduced model is 7
