New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S4 + 3/2*S11
y2 = S6 + -S11
y3 = S7 + S11
y4 = S8 + S11
y5 = S9
y6 = S10 + -1/2*S11
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/10*y1 + 9/10*y2 + 18/5*y4 + 9/10*y5 + 9/10*y6, 11/10*y1 + 11/10*y2 + 22/5*y4 + 11/10*y5 + 11/10*y6)
y1' = (9/10*y2 + 9/10*y4, 11/10*y2 + 11/10*y4)
y2' = (9/10*y4 + 9/5*y6, 11/10*y4 + 11/5*y6)
y3' = (9/5*y4, 11/5*y4)
y4' = (9/10*y5, 11/10*y5)
y5' = (9/10*y3 + 9/5*y6, 11/10*y3 + 11/5*y6)
y6' = (0, 0)
