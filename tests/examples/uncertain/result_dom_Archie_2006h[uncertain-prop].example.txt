===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S2 + S7
y2 = S5 + 1/2*S7
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/10*y1 + 9/5*y2, 11/10*y1 + 11/5*y2)
y1' = (9/5*y2, 11/5*y2)
y2' = (0, 0)
The size of the original model is 9
The size of the reduced model is 3

Is the lumping a Forward Lumping (FL)?: False
Has the lumping a Robust Weighted Lumping (RWL)?: False
