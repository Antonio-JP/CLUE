New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2 + -38/37*S4 + 15/37*S6 + 2/37*S7
y3 = S3 + 17/37*S4 + 4/37*S6 + 3/37*S7
y4 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = (261/10*y1 + 9/5*y2 + 99/10*y3 + 27/10*y4, 319/10*y1 + 11/5*y2 + 121/10*y3 + 33/10*y4)
y1' = (63/10*y2 + 18*y3 + 99/10*y4, 77/10*y2 + 22*y3 + 121/10*y4)
y2' = (9/10*y4, 11/10*y4)
y3' = (9/10*y1, 11/10*y1)
y4' = (0, 0)
