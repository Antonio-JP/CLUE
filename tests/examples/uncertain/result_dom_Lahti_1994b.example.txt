y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 16*y1 + 4*y2 + 16*y3 + 8*y4 + 18*y5 + 10*y6 + 2*y7
y1' = 7*y2 + 11*y3 + 14*y4 + 23*y5 + 5*y6 + 2*y7
y2' = 4*y0 + 2*y1 + 18*y3 + 20*y4 + 5*y5 + 9*y6 + 2*y7
y3' = 21*y4 + 12*y5 + 11*y6
y4' = 2*y1 + 26*y5 + 10*y6
y5' = y1 + 4*y2 + 3*y3 + 7*y4 + 17*y6 + 9*y7
y6' = 2*y4 + 5*y5
y7' = 9*y3
