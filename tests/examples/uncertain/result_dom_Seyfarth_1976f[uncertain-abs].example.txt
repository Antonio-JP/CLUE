New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S2
y2 = S4 + S5
y3 = S6
y4 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = (11999/4000*y1 + 3999/4000*y2 + 3999/4000*y3, 12001/4000*y1 + 4001/4000*y2 + 4001/4000*y3)
y1' = (7999/4000*y3 + 7999/4000*y4, 8001/4000*y3 + 8001/4000*y4)
y2' = (3999/4000*y3 + 5999/2000*y4, 4001/4000*y3 + 6001/2000*y4)
y3' = (3999/4000*y1, 4001/4000*y1)
y4' = (0, 0)
