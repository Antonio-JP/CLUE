New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + 1/2*S4
y2 = S2 + 1/2*S4
y3 = S3 + -1/2*S4
y4 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/5*y1 + 9/10*y2 + 9/10*y3 + 9/10*y4, 11/5*y1 + 11/10*y2 + 11/10*y3 + 11/10*y4)
y1' = (9/5*y2 + 9/5*y4, 11/5*y2 + 11/5*y4)
y2' = (9/10*y1 + 9/10*y3, 11/10*y1 + 11/10*y3)
y3' = (9/10*y0 + 9/10*y4, 11/10*y0 + 11/10*y4)
y4' = (0, 0)
