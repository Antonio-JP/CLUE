===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S2
y2 = S4 + S5
y3 = S6
y4 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = (27/10*y1 + 9/10*y2 + 9/10*y3, 33/10*y1 + 11/10*y2 + 11/10*y3)
y1' = (9/5*y3 + 9/5*y4, 11/5*y3 + 11/5*y4)
y2' = (9/10*y3 + 27/10*y4, 11/10*y3 + 33/10*y4)
y3' = (9/10*y1, 11/10*y1)
y4' = (0, 0)
The size of the original model is 8
