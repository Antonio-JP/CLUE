New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + -128/15*S5
y2 = S2
y3 = S3 + 9/10*S5
y4 = S4
y5 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = 3*y1 + 47*y2 + 34*y3 + 31*y4 + 10*y5
y1' = 5*y2 + 10*y3 + 2*y4
y2' = 70*y3 + 42*y4
y3' = 26*y4 + 2*y5
y4' = 13*y5
y5' = 0
The size of the original model is 7
The size of the reduced model is 6
