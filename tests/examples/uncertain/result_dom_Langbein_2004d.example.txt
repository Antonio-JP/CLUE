New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = 5*y1 + 2*y2 + y5 + y6 + 3*y8
y1' = y0 + y5 + y6 + 3*y8
y2' = y0 + 2*y1 + 2*y8
y3' = y2 + y5 + 2*y7 + y8
y4' = y0 + 2*y1 + 2*y2 + y6
y5' = 3*y8
y6' = y3 + 2*y8
y7' = y6
y8' = y1 + 3*y4 + y5 + y6
The size of the original model is 9
