===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2 + -1/10*S6
y3 = S3 + -3/8*S6
y4 = S4 + 1/10*S6
y5 = S5 + 3/4*S6
Lumped system:
y0' = 6*y1 + y2 + 4*y3 + 6*y4 + 8*y5
y1' = 5*y0 + 5*y2 + 2*y5
y2' = -2/5*y0 + -1/5*y1
y3' = -3/2*y0 + -3/4*y1
y4' = 12/5*y0 + 2*y3 + y5 + 1/5*y1
y5' = 4*y0 + 33/2*y1 + y2 + 11*y4
The size of the original model is 7
The size of the reduced model is 6
