New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + 9*S2
y2 = S3
y3 = S4
y4 = S5
y5 = S6
y6 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 2*y1 + 31*y2 + 14*y3 + 12*y4 + 17*y5 + 9*y6
y1' = 19*y2 + 37*y3 + 30*y6 + 18*y4 + 27*y5
y2' = 2*y3 + 2*y4 + 5*y5 + y6
y3' = y4
y4' = y5 + y6
y5' = 2*y6
y6' = 0
The size of the original model is 8
The size of the reduced model is 7
