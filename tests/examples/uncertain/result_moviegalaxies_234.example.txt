New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 4*y2 + 11*y4 + y6 + y7
y1' = 5*y2 + 2*y4
y2' = 4*y0 + 5*y1 + 2*y5 + y3 + 6*y4 + y6 + 5*y7
y3' = y2 + y4 + y7
y4' = 11*y0 + 2*y1 + 6*y2 + y3 + 2*y6 + 2*y7
y5' = 2*y2
y6' = y0 + y2 + 2*y4 + 2*y7
y7' = y0 + 5*y2 + y3 + 2*y4 + 2*y6
The size of the original model is 8
