y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7 + S8 + S9
y8 = S10
y9 = S11
y10 = S12
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9 + y10
y1' = y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9 + y10
y2' = y3 + y4 + y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9 + y10
y3' = y4 + y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9 + y10
y4' = y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9 + y10
y5' = y6 + y7 + y8 + y9 + y10
y6' = y7 + y8 + y9 + y10
y7' = 3*y8 + 3*y9 + 3*y10 + y7
y8' = y9 + y10
y9' = y10
y10' = 0
