===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 2*y1 + 30*y2 + 6*y3 + 19*y4 + 122*y5
y1' = 18*y2 + 19*y4 + 85*y5
y2' = y1 + 3*y3 + 8*y4 + 84*y5
y3' = 267*y4 + 50*y5
y4' = 5*y3 + 10*y5
y5' = y0 + 4*y2 + 4*y3 + y4
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
