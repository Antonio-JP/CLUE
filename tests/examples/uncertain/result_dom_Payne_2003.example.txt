New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + -23/10*S4
y2 = S2 + -3/10*S4
y3 = S3 + 2*S4
y4 = S5
y5 = S6
y6 = S7
y7 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + 9*y2 + 4*y3 + 3*y4 + 2*y5 + 2*y7
y1' = 10*y2 + 4*y3 + -13/10*y4 + -18/5*y5 + -3/10*y6 + -64/5*y7
y2' = y3 + 17/10*y4 + 2/5*y5 + 27/10*y6 + -9/5*y7
y3' = 6*y4 + 8*y5 + 4*y6 + 14*y7
y4' = y5 + y6 + y7
y5' = 2*y6 + 4*y7
y6' = y7
y7' = y5
The size of the original model is 9
