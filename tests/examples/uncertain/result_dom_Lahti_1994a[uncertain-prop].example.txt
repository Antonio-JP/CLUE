y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = (477/10*y1 + 81/10*y2 + 297/10*y3 + 45/2*y4 + 297/10*y5, 583/10*y1 + 99/10*y2 + 363/10*y3 + 55/2*y4 + 363/10*y5)
y1' = (81/5*y2 + 117/10*y3 + 99/2*y4 + 873/10*y5, 99/5*y2 + 143/10*y3 + 121/2*y4 + 1067/10*y5)
y2' = (72/5*y3 + 27/2*y4 + 63/5*y5, 88/5*y3 + 33/2*y4 + 77/5*y5)
y3' = (351/10*y1 + 27/2*y4 + 108/5*y5, 429/10*y1 + 33/2*y4 + 132/5*y5)
y4' = (9/5*y3 + 297/10*y5, 11/5*y3 + 363/10*y5)
y5' = (9/10*y1, 11/10*y1)
