y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = 25*y1 + 19*y2 + 15*y3 + 6*y4 + 2*y5 + y6 + 2*y7 + 6*y8
y1' = 5*y0 + 21*y2 + 7*y3 + 2*y4 + 3*y5 + y6 + 3*y7 + 3*y8
y2' = 11*y0 + 18*y1 + 6*y3 + y4 + y5 + 2*y6 + y7 + 3*y8
y3' = y0 + 4*y1 + y2 + 4*y4 + 3*y8
y4' = y0 + y3 + y6 + y7 + y8
y5' = y4
y6' = y5
y7' = 0
y8' = y0 + y1
