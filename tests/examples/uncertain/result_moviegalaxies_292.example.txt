===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
Lumped system:
y0' = 5*y1 + 6*y2 + 9*y3 + 5*y4
y1' = 5*y0 + 7*y2 + 7*y3 + 4*y4
y2' = 6*y0 + 7*y1 + 8*y3 + 5*y4
y3' = 9*y0 + 7*y1 + 8*y2 + 8*y4
y4' = 5*y0 + 4*y1 + 5*y2 + 8*y3
The size of the original model is 5
The size of the reduced model is 5
