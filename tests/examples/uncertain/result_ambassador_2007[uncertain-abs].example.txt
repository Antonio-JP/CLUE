===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S6 + S7
y2 = S11
Lumped system:
y0' = (7999/4000*y1 + 3999/4000*y2, 8001/4000*y1 + 4001/4000*y2)
y1' = (7999/2000*y0, 8001/2000*y0)
y2' = (3999/4000*y0, 4001/4000*y0)
The size of the original model is 16
The size of the reduced model is 3
