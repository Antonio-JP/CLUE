New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4 + 5/2*S5
y5 = S6
y6 = S7
y7 = S8
y8 = S9
Lumped system:
y0' = 10*y1 + 2*y2 + 18*y3 + 2*y4 + 40*y5 + 45*y6 + 20*y7 + 31*y8
y1' = y0 + 2*y3 + 2*y5 + 4*y6 + 2*y7 + 2*y8
y2' = 2*y5
y3' = y1 + 8*y5 + 11*y6 + 4*y8
y4' = 5/2*y0 + 5/2*y2 + 5*y6 + 5*y7 + 15/2*y8
y5' = 3*y0 + 5*y3 + 9*y6 + 3*y7 + 5*y8
y6' = 2*y5 + 3*y7 + 8*y8
y7' = y5 + 5*y8
y8' = y5 + y7
