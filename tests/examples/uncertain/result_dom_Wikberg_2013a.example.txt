New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + y2 + y4 + y6 + y7
y1' = 2*y2 + 2*y3 + y4 + y5 + y6 + 2*y7
y2' = y1 + y5 + y6 + 3*y7
y3' = 2*y4 + y6 + y7
y4' = y5 + y7
y5' = y4
y6' = y3
y7' = y1
The size of the original model is 8
The size of the reduced model is 8
