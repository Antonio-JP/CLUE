New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + 43/20*S5 + 12941/3320*S7
y2 = S2 + -3/10*S5 + -1281/1660*S7
y3 = S3 + -43/20*S5 + -12941/3320*S7
y4 = S4 + 21/20*S5 + 3807/3320*S7
y5 = S6 + 40/83*S7
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + y3
y1' = 7*y2 + 2*y4 + 129/20*y5
y2' = y3 + 3*y4 + 51/10*y5
y3' = 2*y0 + y2 + 6*y4 + -129/20*y5
y4' = 83/20*y5
y5' = 0
The size of the original model is 8
The size of the reduced model is 6
