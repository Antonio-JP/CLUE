New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/10*y1 + 9/10*y2 + 9/10*y3 + 9/10*y4, 11/10*y1 + 11/10*y2 + 11/10*y3 + 11/10*y4)
y1' = (9/10*y3 + 18/5*y5, 11/10*y3 + 22/5*y5)
y2' = (27/10*y3 + 9/10*y4 + 9/10*y6, 33/10*y3 + 11/10*y4 + 11/10*y6)
y3' = (9/5*y2 + 27/10*y4 + 9/10*y5, 11/5*y2 + 33/10*y4 + 11/10*y5)
y4' = (9/5*y3 + 9/5*y5 + 9/10*y6, 11/5*y3 + 11/5*y5 + 11/10*y6)
y5' = (9/10*y6, 11/10*y6)
y6' = (0, 0)
