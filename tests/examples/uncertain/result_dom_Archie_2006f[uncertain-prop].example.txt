New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2 + 1/6*S5
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/10*y1 + 27/5*y2 + 27/10*y3 + 9/10*y5, 11/10*y1 + 33/5*y2 + 33/10*y3 + 11/10*y5)
y1' = (9/10*y3 + 9/10*y4 + 18/5*y5, 11/10*y3 + 11/10*y4 + 22/5*y5)
y2' = (9/10*y0 + 27/10*y3 + 9/10*y4 + 3/20*y5, 11/10*y0 + 33/10*y3 + 11/10*y4 + 11/60*y5)
y3' = (0, 0)
y4' = (9/10*y5, 11/10*y5)
y5' = (9/10*y1, 11/10*y1)
