New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = 23*y1 + y4 + 2*y5 + 2*y6
y1' = 25*y0 + 16*y2 + 19*y3 + 26*y4 + 11*y5 + 12*y6
y2' = 26*y1
y3' = 2*y0 + 35*y1 + y2 + 4*y4 + 2*y5 + 2*y6
y4' = 2*y0 + 12*y1
y5' = 4*y0 + 16*y1 + 2*y3
y6' = 4*y0 + 2*y1 + 2*y5
The size of the original model is 7
