New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
y9 = S9
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + 7*y2 + 4*y3 + y4 + 26*y5 + 2*y6 + 9*y7 + y8 + 2*y9
y1' = 12*y0 + y2 + 2*y3 + 5*y5 + y6 + 3*y7 + y8
y2' = 2*y3
y3' = y0 + y1 + y2 + 2*y5 + y8
y4' = 12*y0 + y2 + 10*y5 + y6 + 7*y7 + y8
y5' = 2*y0 + 3*y2 + 6*y3 + 3*y4 + 2*y7
y6' = y1 + y2
y7' = y0 + 2*y3 + y4 + 11*y5 + y8
y8' = 7*y5
y9' = 0
The size of the original model is 10
