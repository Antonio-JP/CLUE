===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S5
y2 = S6
y3 = S7
y4 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = (19999/4000*y1 + 7999/4000*y2 + 15999/4000*y3 + 7999/4000*y4, 20001/4000*y1 + 8001/4000*y2 + 16001/4000*y3 + 8001/4000*y4)
y1' = (3999/4000*y2, 4001/4000*y2)
y2' = (11999/4000*y3, 12001/4000*y3)
y3' = (0, 0)
y4' = (0, 0)
The size of the original model is 9
