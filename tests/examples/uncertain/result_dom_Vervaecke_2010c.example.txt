New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = 7*y1 + y2 + y3 + y5 + 2*y6
y1' = 14*y0 + y2 + 13*y4 + 2*y5 + 8*y6
y2' = 2*y0 + y1 + y4 + y6
y3' = 2*y0 + 2*y1 + 2*y2 + y5 + y6
y4' = 5*y0 + 3*y1 + y3 + 2*y5 + 4*y6
y5' = 7*y0 + 9*y1 + y3 + 5*y4 + 7*y6
y6' = 10*y0 + 8*y1 + y3 + 7*y4 + y5
The size of the original model is 7
The size of the reduced model is 7
