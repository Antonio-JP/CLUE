===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 9*y1 + 5*y2 + 12*y3 + y4 + 3*y5
y1' = 34*y2 + 10*y3 + 5*y4 + 8*y5
y2' = 35*y3 + 9*y4 + 14*y5
y3' = 10*y4 + 13*y5
y4' = 6*y5
y5' = 0
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
