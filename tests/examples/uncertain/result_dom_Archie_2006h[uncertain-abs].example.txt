===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S2
y2 = S5
y3 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = (3999/4000*y1 + 7999/4000*y2 + 7999/4000*y3, 4001/4000*y1 + 8001/4000*y2 + 8001/4000*y3)
y1' = (7999/4000*y2 + 3999/4000*y3, 8001/4000*y2 + 4001/4000*y3)
y2' = (0, 0)
y3' = (0, 0)
The size of the original model is 9
The size of the reduced model is 4
