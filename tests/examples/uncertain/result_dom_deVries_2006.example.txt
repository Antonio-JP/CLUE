New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = y2 + 2*y3 + 10*y4 + 63*y5 + 8*y6
y1' = 2*y2 + 3*y3 + 88*y5 + 4*y6
y2' = 4*y3 + 65*y4 + 84*y5 + 3*y6
y3' = 80*y5 + 10*y6
y4' = 4*y5 + y6
y5' = y1 + 5*y2 + 10*y4 + 6*y6
y6' = 2*y5
The size of the original model is 7
The size of the reduced model is 7
