New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = 21*y1 + 3*y2 + 51*y4 + 5*y6
y1' = 10*y0 + 3*y2 + 6*y3 + 21*y4 + 3*y5 + y6
y2' = 2*y3
y3' = y0 + 3*y1 + y2
y4' = y0 + 3*y5 + 12*y6
y5' = 4*y0 + y1 + y6
y6' = 5*y0 + y1 + y3
The size of the original model is 7
The size of the reduced model is 7
