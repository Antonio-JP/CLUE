New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = y3
y1' = y2 + y3
y2' = y1 + 21*y3 + 2*y4 + 6*y5 + 14*y7
y3' = y0 + y1 + 21*y2 + 2*y4 + y8 + 7*y5 + y6 + 18*y7
y4' = 2*y2 + 2*y3 + y5 + y7
y5' = 6*y2 + 7*y3 + y4 + 5*y7 + y8
y6' = y3
y7' = 14*y2 + 18*y3 + y4 + 5*y5
y8' = y3 + y5
