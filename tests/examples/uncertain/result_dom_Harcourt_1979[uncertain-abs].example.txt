New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + S2 + S3
y2 = S4
y3 = S5
y4 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = (3999/4000*y1 + 19999/4000*y2 + 7999/4000*y3 + 27999/4000*y4, 4001/4000*y1 + 20001/4000*y2 + 8001/4000*y3 + 28001/4000*y4)
y1' = (27999/2000*y4 + 3999/4000*y3, 28001/2000*y4 + 4001/4000*y3)
y2' = (7999/4000*y3, 8001/4000*y3)
y3' = (0, 0)
y4' = (0, 0)
