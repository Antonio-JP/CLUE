===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S6
y2 = S7
y3 = S11
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/5*y1 + 9/5*y2 + 9/10*y3, 11/5*y1 + 11/5*y2 + 11/10*y3)
y1' = (9/5*y0 + 9/5*y3, 11/5*y0 + 11/5*y3)
y2' = (9/5*y0, 11/5*y0)
y3' = (9/10*y0 + 9/5*y1, 11/10*y0 + 11/5*y1)
The size of the original model is 16
