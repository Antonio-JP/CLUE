New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = (81/10*y1 + 9/2*y2 + 54/5*y3 + 9/10*y4 + 27/10*y5, 99/10*y1 + 11/2*y2 + 66/5*y3 + 11/10*y4 + 33/10*y5)
y1' = (153/5*y2 + 9*y3 + 9/2*y4 + 36/5*y5, 187/5*y2 + 11*y3 + 11/2*y4 + 44/5*y5)
y2' = (63/2*y3 + 81/10*y4 + 63/5*y5, 77/2*y3 + 99/10*y4 + 77/5*y5)
y3' = (9*y4 + 117/10*y5, 11*y4 + 143/10*y5)
y4' = (27/5*y5, 33/5*y5)
y5' = (0, 0)
