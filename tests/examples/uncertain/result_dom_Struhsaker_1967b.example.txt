y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
y9 = S9
y10 = S10
y11 = S11
Lumped system:
y0' = 6*y1 + y2 + y4 + 3*y5 + y6 + y9 + y10 + 2*y11
y1' = 2*y2 + 3*y3 + y5 + 3*y6 + 2*y7 + 3*y10 + y11
y2' = y3 + y5
y3' = y4 + y6 + y7
y4' = y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y10 + 2*y11
y5' = 2*y8
y6' = y2 + 3*y7 + 2*y9 + 5*y10 + 5*y11
y7' = y8
y8' = 3*y6 + 4*y9 + 3*y11
y9' = 4*y11
y10' = y7 + 2*y11
y11' = y10
