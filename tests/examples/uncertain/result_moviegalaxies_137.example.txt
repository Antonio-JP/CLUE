y2 = S2 + S9
y3 = S3 + S7
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S8
y8 = S10
y9 = S11
Lumped system:
y0' = 12*y7 + y3 + y5 + 2*y6
y1' = y4 + 2*y5 + 2*y6 + y9
y2' = 2*y7 + y2
y3' = 2*y0
y4' = y1 + y5 + 2*y9 + y6
y5' = y0 + 2*y1 + y4 + 2*y6 + y7 + 5*y8 + 2*y9
y6' = 2*y0 + 2*y1 + y4 + 2*y5 + 2*y9 + y7
y7' = 12*y0 + y2 + y5 + y6
y8' = 5*y5
y9' = y1 + 2*y4 + 2*y5 + 2*y6
