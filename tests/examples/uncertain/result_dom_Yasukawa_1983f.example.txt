===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 21*y1 + 7*y2 + 3*y3 + 4*y4 + 17*y5
y1' = 15*y2 + 11*y3 + 15*y4 + 20*y5
y2' = 22*y3 + 4*y4 + 23*y5
y3' = 2*y2 + 19*y4 + 10*y5
y4' = 11*y2 + 4*y3 + 7*y5
y5' = 3*y4
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
