New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2 + 14*S7
y3 = S3 + 1/4*S5 + 1/3*S6 + -7/12*S7
y4 = S4
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/10*y1, 11/10*y1)
y1' = (9/10*y2 + 54/5*y3 + 171/10*y4, 11/10*y2 + 66/5*y3 + 209/10*y4)
y2' = (9/10*y1 + 9/2*y4, 11/10*y1 + 11/2*y4)
y3' = (27/10*y4, 33/10*y4)
y4' = (9/10*y1 + 9/10*y2, 11/10*y1 + 11/10*y2)
