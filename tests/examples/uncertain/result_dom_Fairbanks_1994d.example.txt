New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + 6*y2 + 12*y3 + 12*y4 + 8*y5 + 11*y6 + 11*y7 + y8
y1' = 3*y2 + y5 + 2*y6 + y7
y2' = 9*y3 + 22*y5 + 7*y6 + 2*y7
y3' = 2*y1 + 3*y2 + 4*y4 + 6*y5 + 2*y6 + 7*y7 + 4*y8
y4' = y6 + 2*y7 + y8
y5' = y2 + y3 + 6*y6 + 2*y7 + 2*y8
y6' = 8*y3 + 2*y5 + 3*y7
y7' = y8
y8' = 0
