New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S2
y2 = S3
y3 = S4
y4 = S5
y5 = S6
y6 = S7
y7 = S8
y8 = S9
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + 3*y3 + 6*y4 + y5 + 4*y7 + 2*y8
y1' = y2 + 3*y3 + 5*y4 + 2*y5 + y6 + y7 + 3*y8
y2' = 6*y3 + y5 + y7 + 2*y8
y3' = y4 + y6 + 2*y7 + 2*y8
y4' = y2 + y5 + y6 + 2*y7 + 2*y8
y5' = y7 + y8
y6' = 2*y5 + y7
y7' = y3 + y5 + 2*y6
y8' = y6 + y7
The size of the original model is 10
