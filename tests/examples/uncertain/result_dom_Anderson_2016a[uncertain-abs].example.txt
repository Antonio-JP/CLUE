y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = (31999/4000*y1 + 3999/4000*y2 + 15999/4000*y3 + 11999/4000*y5, 32001/4000*y1 + 4001/4000*y2 + 16001/4000*y3 + 12001/4000*y5)
y1' = (19999/4000*y2 + 23999/4000*y5, 20001/4000*y2 + 24001/4000*y5)
y2' = (19999/4000*y3 + 15999/4000*y4 + 31999/4000*y5, 20001/4000*y3 + 16001/4000*y4 + 32001/4000*y5)
