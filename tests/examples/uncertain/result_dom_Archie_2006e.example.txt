New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2 + -12/5*S10
y3 = S3 + -1/10*S10
y4 = S4 + 4/5*S10
y5 = S5 + -1/5*S10
y6 = S6 + S10
y7 = S7 + 1/5*S10
y8 = S8 + 1/5*S10
y9 = S9
Lumped system:
y0' = y2 + y4 + y5 + y6 + 4*y8
y1' = 2*y3 + 3*y5 + 4*y7 + 2*y9
y2' = 2*y3 + y8 + -24/5*y9
y3' = y4 + y6 + y8 + -1/5*y9
y4' = y5 + y8 + 8/5*y9
y5' = 5*y7 + 8/5*y9
y6' = y4 + y7 + 2*y9
y7' = y1 + 7/5*y9
y8' = 2/5*y9
y9' = 0
