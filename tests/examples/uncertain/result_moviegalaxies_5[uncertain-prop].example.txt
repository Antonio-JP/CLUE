===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + S8
y2 = S2 + S3
y3 = S4 + 5*S5 + S6 + S7
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/10*y1 + 18/5*y2 + 9/10*y3, 11/10*y1 + 22/5*y2 + 11/10*y3)
y1' = (9/5*y0 + 9/10*y1, 11/5*y0 + 11/10*y1)
y2' = (36/5*y0 + 18/5*y2, 44/5*y0 + 22/5*y2)
y3' = (126/5*y0, 154/5*y0)
The size of the original model is 9
