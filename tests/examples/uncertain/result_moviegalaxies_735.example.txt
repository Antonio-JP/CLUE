Lumped system:
y0' = 2*y4 + y12
y1' = 2*y12 + y1
y2' = 2*y5 + y7
y3' = y5 + y10 + 5*y12 + y14 + y4 + y8 + y11
y4' = 2*y0 + y3 + y10 + y12 + 3*y13
y5' = 2*y2 + y3 + y7
y6' = y8 + y12 + y7
y7' = y2 + y5 + y6 + y8 + y12 + y13
y8' = y3 + y6 + y7 + 2*y12
y9' = y13
y10' = y3 + y4 + y12
y11' = y3 + y13 + 4*y12
y12' = y0 + y1 + 5*y3 + y4 + y6 + y7 + 2*y8 + y10 + 4*y11 + y14
y13' = 3*y4 + y7 + y9 + y11
y14' = y3 + y12
