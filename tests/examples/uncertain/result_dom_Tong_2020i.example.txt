y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8
y9 = S9
y10 = S10
y11 = S11
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + 8*y3 + y4 + y6 + y7 + 3*y11
y1' = y0 + y2 + 2*y3 + y4 + 2*y5 + y7 + y8 + 2*y9 + 2*y10
y2' = y3 + 2*y4 + y5 + y7 + 3*y9 + 2*y10
y3' = 2*y0 + y6 + y8 + 2*y9 + y10 + 2*y11
y4' = y5 + y7 + 4*y9 + y11
y5' = y6 + y7
y6' = y1 + y3 + 2*y7 + y10
y7' = y8 + 6*y9 + 3*y10
y8' = y9
y9' = 2*y2 + 2*y4 + y5 + 2*y6 + y10
y10' = y1 + y3 + y4 + y9
y11' = y4
