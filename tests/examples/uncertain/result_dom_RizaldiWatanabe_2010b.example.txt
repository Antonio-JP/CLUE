New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 6*y1 + 10*y2 + 8*y3 + 6*y4 + 11*y5 + 13*y6 + 9*y7
y1' = 4*y0 + 6*y2 + 3*y3 + 4*y4 + 6*y5 + 10*y6 + 8*y7
y2' = y0 + y1 + 3*y3 + 8*y4 + 9*y5 + 9*y6 + 5*y7
y3' = 3*y0 + 2*y1 + 3*y2 + 3*y4 + 2*y5 + 3*y6 + 3*y7
y4' = y0 + 7*y5 + 3*y7
y5' = y1 + 11*y6 + 5*y7
y6' = y1 + y5 + 9*y7
y7' = 3*y5
The size of the original model is 8
