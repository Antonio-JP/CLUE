===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 18*y1 + 12*y2 + 11*y3 + 12*y4 + 4*y5
y1' = 26*y0 + y2 + 3*y3 + 4*y4 + 3*y5
y2' = y1 + 6*y3 + 10*y4 + 4*y5
y3' = 2*y2 + 8*y4 + y5
y4' = 4*y3 + y5
y5' = 0
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
