New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + -8/3*S5
y2 = S2 + 19/7*S5
y3 = S3 + 7/3*S5
y4 = S4
Lumped system:
y0' = (36/5*y1 + 63/10*y2 + 9/10*y3 + 117/10*y4, 44/5*y1 + 77/10*y2 + 11/10*y3 + 143/10*y4)
y1' = (9/5*y0 + 27/10*y3 + 36/5*y4, 11/5*y0 + 33/10*y3 + 44/5*y4)
y2' = (9/10*y0 + 9/5*y1 + 18/5*y3 + 117/10*y4, 11/10*y0 + 11/5*y1 + 22/5*y3 + 143/10*y4)
y3' = (36/5*y4, 44/5*y4)
y4' = (0, 0)
