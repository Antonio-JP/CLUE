New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + y2 + 2*y3 + 2*y4 + y5 + 5*y6
y1' = y2 + 2*y3 + y4 + y5 + 2*y6
y2' = y3 + y4 + y5 + 2*y6
y3' = y4 + 2*y5 + y6
y4' = 2*y5 + y6
y5' = y6
y6' = y5
The size of the original model is 7
The size of the reduced model is 7
