New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = 7*y1 + 8*y2 + 7*y3 + 8*y4 + 5*y5 + 13*y6
y1' = 12*y2 + 11*y3 + y5 + 18*y6
y2' = 16*y3 + 20*y4 + 39*y5 + 27*y6
y3' = 10*y4 + 27*y5 + 18*y6
y4' = 6*y1 + y3 + 6*y5 + y6
y5' = 14*y1 + y2 + 5*y4 + 22*y6
y6' = 0
The size of the original model is 7
