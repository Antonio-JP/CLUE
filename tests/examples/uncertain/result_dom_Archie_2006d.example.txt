===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 4*y1 + 5*y2 + y4
y1' = 2*y2 + y3 + 6*y4 + 2*y5
y2' = y1 + 4*y3 + 5*y4 + 2*y5
y3' = 3*y4 + 2*y5
y4' = y5
y5' = 0
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
