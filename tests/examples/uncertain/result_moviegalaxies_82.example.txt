New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3 + S6
y4 = S4 + 1/3*S8 + 1/3*S10 + 2/3*S12
y5 = S5
y6 = S7
y7 = S9 + S15
y8 = S11
y9 = S13
y10 = S14
Lumped system:
y0' = y6
y1' = y2 + y3 + y5 + 3*y9
y2' = y1 + y5
y3' = 2*y1
y4' = 5*y9
y5' = y1 + y2 + 2*y6 + 4*y10 + 3*y9
y6' = y0 + 2*y5 + 10*y9 + 2*y7 + y8 + y10
y7' = 4*y6 + 2*y8 + y7
y8' = y6 + y7
y9' = 3*y1 + 3*y4 + 3*y5 + 10*y6 + 2*y10
y10' = 4*y5 + y6 + 2*y9
