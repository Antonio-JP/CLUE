New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 16*y1 + 11*y2 + 5*y3 + 4*y4 + 4*y5 + 4*y6 + y7
y1' = 7*y2 + 6*y3 + 16*y4 + 4*y5 + 4*y6 + 6*y7
y2' = 4*y3 + 7*y4 + 10*y5 + 10*y6 + 3*y7
y3' = 12*y4 + 13*y5 + 8*y6 + 8*y7
y4' = 3*y5 + 8*y6 + 5*y7
y5' = 5*y6 + 2*y7
y6' = 11*y7
y7' = 0
The size of the original model is 8
