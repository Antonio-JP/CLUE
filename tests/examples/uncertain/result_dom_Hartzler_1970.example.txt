New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = 5*y1 + 18*y2 + 8*y3 + 15*y4 + 11*y5 + 7*y6
y1' = 4*y2 + 9*y4 + 6*y5 + 9*y6
y2' = 2*y3 + 2*y4 + 6*y5 + y6
y3' = 3*y0 + 3*y5 + 2*y6
y4' = 12*y5 + 6*y6
y5' = 2*y2 + y4 + 6*y6
y6' = 0
The size of the original model is 7
