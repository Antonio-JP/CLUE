New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + S11
y2 = S2 + S10
y3 = S3
y4 = S4 + S6 + 2*S8 + 7*S9 + -S11 + S13
y5 = S5
y6 = S7
y7 = S12
Lumped system:
y0' = y5
y1' = 2*y7 + 5*y5
y2' = 4*y5 + 2*y2
y3' = 2*y5 + y6 + y7
y4' = 54*y5 + -y7
y5' = y0 + 3*y1 + 2*y2 + 2*y3 + y4 + y6 + 13*y7
y6' = y3 + y5 + y7
y7' = y1 + y3 + 13*y5 + y6
