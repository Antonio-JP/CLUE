y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 9*y1 + 30*y2 + 36*y3 + 8*y4 + 23*y5 + 63*y6 + 64*y7
y1' = 13*y0 + 24*y2 + 13*y3 + 2*y4 + 6*y5 + 14*y6 + 13*y7
y2' = y0 + 50*y3 + 24*y4 + 18*y5 + 41*y6 + 24*y7
y3' = 14*y4 + 31*y5 + 25*y6 + 30*y7
y4' = 8*y6 + 2*y7
y5' = y0 + 8*y4 + 30*y6 + 9*y7
y6' = 31*y7
y7' = y5
