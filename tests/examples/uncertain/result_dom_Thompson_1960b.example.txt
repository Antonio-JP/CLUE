===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + 1/5*S3
y2 = S2 + 2*S3
y3 = S4
y4 = S5
y5 = S6
y6 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 10*y1 + y2 + 12*y3 + 3*y4 + 5*y5 + 3*y6
y1' = y2 + 61/5*y3 + 12/5*y4 + 22/5*y5 + 12/5*y6
y2' = 15*y3 + 5*y4 + 5*y5 + 4*y6
y3' = 6*y4 + 2*y5 + 3*y6
y4' = 2*y5 + 7*y6
y5' = 6*y6
y6' = 0
The size of the original model is 8
