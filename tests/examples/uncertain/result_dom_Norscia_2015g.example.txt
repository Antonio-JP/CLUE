Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + 3*y2 + 2*y4 + 2*y7 + y8 + 3*y9
y1' = 2*y7 + 12*y9
y2' = 2*y1 + y3 + 3*y4 + 2*y5 + 4*y6 + 4*y9
y3' = 18*y0 + 5*y1 + 5*y2 + 2*y5 + y6 + 2*y7 + 3*y8 + y9
y4' = 3*y5 + 4*y7
y5' = 4*y1 + y2 + 2*y4 + y6 + 2*y7 + 10*y9
y6' = 3*y7
y7' = 0
y8' = 18*y0 + 4*y1 + 3*y2 + 5*y4 + 2*y5 + 4*y7 + 2*y9
