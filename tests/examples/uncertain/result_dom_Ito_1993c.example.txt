New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + 7/100*S4 + -3/100*S9 + -2717/80000*S10
y2 = S2 + 1/10*S4 + 1/10*S9 + 539/8000*S10
y3 = S3 + 11/160*S10
y4 = S5 + -1/4*S10
y5 = S6 + 1/2*S10
y6 = S7
y7 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = 10*y1 + 3*y2 + 2*y3 + y6 + y7
y1' = 10*y2 + 5*y3 + 407/100*y4 + 2*y6 + y7
y2' = 4*y3 + 11/10*y4
y3' = 2*y4 + y5 + y6
y4' = 2*y5 + 2*y6
y5' = 4*y6
y6' = y7
y7' = 0
The size of the original model is 11
