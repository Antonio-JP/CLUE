y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4 + S17
y5 = S5 + S7 + S8 + 2*S11 + 3*S12
y6 = S6
y7 = S9
y8 = S10
y9 = S13
y10 = S14
y11 = S15
y12 = S16
Lumped system:
y0' = y2 + y3 + y10
y1' = 3*y2 + y10
y2' = y0 + 3*y1 + y5 + y6 + y8 + 20*y10 + y3 + y4 + 7*y7 + 2*y9 + y11 + y12
y3' = y0 + y2 + y10
y4' = 2*y2 + y4
y5' = 16*y2
y6' = y2 + y10 + y11
y7' = 7*y2 + y10 + y8 + y11
y8' = y2 + y7 + y10
y9' = 2*y2 + y10 + y12
y10' = y0 + y1 + 20*y2 + y3 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9 + y11 + y12
