y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
y8 = S8

y10 = S10
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + 3*y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 + 3*y6 + 2*y7 + 2*y8 + y10
y1' = y0 + 4*y2 + 3*y3 + y5 + y6 + 2*y7 + 2*y9 + 2*y10
y2' = y3 + 2*y8
y3' = y4 + y8
y4' = y1 + y2 + 2*y3 + 2*y6 + 2*y8
y5' = 2*y0 + 2*y1 + y4 + y6 + 5*y8
y6' = y3 + y8
y7' = y1 + 2*y6
y8' = 5*y5 + 10*y6 + 6*y10
y9' = 2*y1 + y3 + y4 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y10
y10' = y7 + 2*y8
