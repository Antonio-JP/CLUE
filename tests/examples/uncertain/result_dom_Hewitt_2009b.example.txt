New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = 6*y1 + 4*y2 + 4*y4 + 11*y5 + 5*y6
y1' = 5*y2 + 5*y4 + 22*y5 + 7*y6
y2' = 3*y1 + 2*y4 + 7*y5 + 4*y6
y3' = 0
y4' = 3*y1 + y2 + y5 + 2*y6
y5' = 4*y1 + y2 + y3 + 3*y4 + 5*y6
y6' = y1 + y4 + 10*y5
The size of the original model is 7
