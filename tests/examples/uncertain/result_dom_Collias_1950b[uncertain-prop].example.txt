New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + -96/35*S6
y2 = S2 + 24*S6
y3 = S3
y4 = S4 + S6
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = (63/2*y1 + 18/5*y2 + 18/5*y3 + 9/5*y4 + 9/10*y5, 77/2*y1 + 22/5*y2 + 22/5*y3 + 11/5*y4 + 11/10*y5)
y1' = (0, 0)
y2' = (27/5*y3 + 9/10*y4 + 117/10*y5, 33/5*y3 + 11/10*y4 + 143/10*y5)
y3' = (9/10*y2 + 27/5*y4 + 9/5*y5, 11/10*y2 + 33/5*y4 + 11/5*y5)
y4' = (9/10*y5, 11/10*y5)
y5' = (9/10*y3, 11/10*y3)
