y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = 8*y1 + 4*y2 + 5*y3 + 8*y4 + 5*y5 + 3*y6 + 3*y7
y1' = 15*y2 + 5*y3 + 9*y4 + 7*y5 + 4*y6 + 2*y7
y2' = 15*y3 + 16*y4 + 3*y6 + 4*y7
y3' = 9*y4 + 10*y5 + 3*y6 + 4*y7
y4' = 11*y5 + 3*y6 + 2*y7
y5' = 25*y2 + 7*y6 + 7*y7
y6' = 5*y7
y7' = 0
