y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/10*y1 + 9/10*y2 + 9/10*y3 + 9/10*y5 + 9/10*y6, 11/10*y1 + 11/10*y2 + 11/10*y3 + 11/10*y5 + 11/10*y6)
y1' = (9/10*y2 + 9/10*y3 + 9/10*y5 + 9/10*y6, 11/10*y2 + 11/10*y3 + 11/10*y5 + 11/10*y6)
y2' = (9/10*y3 + 9/10*y4 + 9/10*y5 + 9/10*y6, 11/10*y3 + 11/10*y4 + 11/10*y5 + 11/10*y6)
y3' = (9/10*y4 + 9/10*y5 + 9/10*y6, 11/10*y4 + 11/10*y5 + 11/10*y6)
y4' = (9/10*y5 + 9/10*y6, 11/10*y5 + 11/10*y6)
y5' = (9/10*y6, 11/10*y6)
