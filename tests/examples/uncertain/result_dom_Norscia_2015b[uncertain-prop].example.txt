New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S3
y2 = S4
y3 = S9
y4 = S11
Lumped system:
y0' = (36/5*y1 + 54/5*y2 + 9/5*y3 + 99/10*y4, 44/5*y1 + 66/5*y2 + 11/5*y3 + 121/10*y4)
y1' = (0, 0)
y2' = (18/5*y1 + 9/5*y3 + 9/10*y4, 22/5*y1 + 11/5*y3 + 11/10*y4)
y3' = (9/10*y1, 11/10*y1)
y4' = (9/10*y0 + 9/5*y1 + 18/5*y2 + 9/5*y3, 11/10*y0 + 11/5*y1 + 22/5*y2 + 11/5*y3)
The size of the original model is 13
