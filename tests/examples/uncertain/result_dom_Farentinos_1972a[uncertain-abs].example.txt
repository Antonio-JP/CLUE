New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = (91999/4000*y1 + 339999/4000*y3 + 67999/4000*y4 + 151999/4000*y5, 92001/4000*y1 + 340001/4000*y3 + 68001/4000*y4 + 152001/4000*y5)
y1' = (3999/4000*y2 + 3999/4000*y3, 4001/4000*y2 + 4001/4000*y3)
y2' = (11999/4000*y1, 12001/4000*y1)
y3' = (11999/4000*y5, 12001/4000*y5)
y4' = (7999/4000*y1 + 7999/4000*y2 + 7999/4000*y3 + 15999/4000*y5, 8001/4000*y1 + 8001/4000*y2 + 8001/4000*y3 + 16001/4000*y5)
