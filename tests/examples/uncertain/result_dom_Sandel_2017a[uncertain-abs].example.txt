y1 = S8 + S20
y2 = S9
y3 = S10
y4 = S16
y5 = S19
y6 = S21
Lumped system:
y0' = (3999/4000*y1 + 7999/4000*y2 + 7999/4000*y3 + 11999/4000*y5 + 3999/4000*y6, 4001/4000*y1 + 8001/4000*y2 + 8001/4000*y3 + 12001/4000*y5 + 4001/4000*y6)
y1' = (3999/4000*y4, 4001/4000*y4)
y2' = (3999/4000*y4 + 3999/4000*y5 + 3999/4000*y6, 4001/4000*y4 + 4001/4000*y5 + 4001/4000*y6)
y3' = (3999/4000*y2 + 3999/4000*y6, 4001/4000*y2 + 4001/4000*y6)
y4' = (0, 0)
y5' = (3999/4000*y6, 4001/4000*y6)
