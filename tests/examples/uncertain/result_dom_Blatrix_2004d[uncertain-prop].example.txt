===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + S3
y2 = S2
y3 = S4
y4 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/10*y1 + 18/5*y2, 11/10*y1 + 22/5*y2)
y1' = (36/5*y2 + 9/10*y3 + 63/10*y4, 44/5*y2 + 11/10*y3 + 77/10*y4)
y2' = (54/5*y3 + 81/5*y4, 66/5*y3 + 99/5*y4)
y3' = (9/10*y4, 11/10*y4)
y4' = (0, 0)
The size of the original model is 6
