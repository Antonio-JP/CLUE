New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 43*y1 + 40*y2 + 61*y3 + 158*y4 + 58*y5
y1' = y0 + 34*y2 + 10*y3 + 14*y4 + 9*y5
y2' = y0 + 2*y1 + 16*y3 + 10*y4 + 8*y5
y3' = 6*y1 + 6*y2 + 21*y4 + 7*y5
y4' = y0 + 2*y1 + 4*y2 + 8*y3 + 21*y5
y5' = y1 + y2 + 4*y4
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
