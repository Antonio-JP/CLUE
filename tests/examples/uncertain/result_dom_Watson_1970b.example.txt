New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 56*y1 + 140*y2 + 24*y3 + 22*y4 + 14*y5
y1' = 22*y0 + 6*y2 + 10*y3 + 10*y4 + 6*y5
y2' = 2*y0 + 8*y1 + 4*y3 + 8*y5
y3' = 26*y0 + 4*y1 + 9*y2 + 8*y4 + 9*y5
y4' = 2*y5
y5' = 2*y2 + 4*y3 + 4*y4
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
