New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 11*y1 + 57*y2 + 2*y3 + 30*y4 + 24*y5
y1' = 6*y0 + 8*y2 + 2*y3 + 2*y4 + 16*y5
y2' = 4*y0 + 4*y1 + 11*y3 + 22*y4 + 21*y5
y3' = 3*y0 + 4*y2 + 7*y4 + 19*y5
y4' = 2*y0 + 4*y2 + 5*y5
y5' = y4
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
