===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 3*y1 + 7*y2 + 2*y3 + 5*y4 + 8*y5
y1' = 2*y2 + 13*y3 + 2*y4 + 3*y5
y2' = 7*y0 + 2*y3 + 3*y4 + 3*y5
y3' = 6*y0 + 2*y1 + y2 + 4*y4 + 2*y5
y4' = 5*y5
y5' = y4
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
