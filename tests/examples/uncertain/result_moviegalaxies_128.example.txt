New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + S11 + S12 + S14
y2 = S2 + S5 + S9 + S10 + S13
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S6
y6 = S7
y7 = S8
y8 = S15
Lumped system:
y0' = 3*y7 + y8
y1' = 4*y5 + 4*y7
y2' = 5*y5
y3' = y4 + 2*y5 + y6
y4' = y3 + 2*y5 + 2*y6
y5' = y1 + y2 + 2*y3 + 2*y4 + y6 + 9*y7 + 4*y8
y6' = y3 + 2*y4 + y5
y7' = 3*y0 + y1 + 9*y5 + y8
y8' = y0 + 4*y5 + y7
