New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2 + 3*S7
y3 = S3 + S4 + -3*S7
y4 = S6
y5 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = (9/10*y1 + 9/10*y2 + 9/10*y3 + 27/10*y4, 11/10*y1 + 11/10*y2 + 11/10*y3 + 33/10*y4)
y1' = (9/10*y2, 11/10*y2)
y2' = (9/10*y5 + 27/10*y1, 11/10*y5 + 33/10*y1)
y3' = (-9/5*y1 + 27/10*y5 + 9/10*y4, -11/5*y1 + 33/10*y5 + 11/10*y4)
y4' = (9/10*y5, 11/10*y5)
y5' = (0, 0)
