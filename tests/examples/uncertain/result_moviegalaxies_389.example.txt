y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4 + S5 + S6
y5 = S7 + S8
y6 = S9
y7 = S10
y8 = S11
y9 = S12
Lumped system:
y0' = y3 + y6
y1' = 8*y2 + 2*y9 + 3*y3 + 6*y6
y2' = 8*y1 + y8 + 5*y3 + 10*y6 + y9
y3' = y0 + 3*y1 + 5*y2 + y4 + y5 + 17*y6 + y9
y4' = 3*y3 + 2*y4
y5' = 2*y3 + 2*y6
y6' = y0 + 6*y1 + 10*y2 + 17*y3 + y5 + y7 + y8 + y9
y7' = y6
y8' = y2 + y6
y9' = 2*y1 + y2 + y3 + y6
