===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = 21*y1 + 17*y2 + 20*y3 + 16*y4 + 2*y5
y1' = 7*y2 + 3*y3 + 9*y4 + y5
y2' = 19*y4 + 20*y5
y3' = 7*y2 + 15*y4
y4' = 5*y2 + 2*y3
y5' = y1 + 7*y2 + y3 + 2*y4
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
