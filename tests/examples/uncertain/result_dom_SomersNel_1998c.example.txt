New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S2
y2 = S3
y3 = S4
y4 = S5
y5 = S6
y6 = S7
y7 = S8
Lumped system:
y0' = 2*y1 + y2 + 4*y3 + 6*y4 + 11*y5 + 2*y6 + 4*y7
y1' = 6*y2 + 4*y3 + y5 + 4*y6 + 7*y7
y2' = 6*y3 + 2*y5 + 8*y6
y3' = y2 + 2*y4 + y5 + 2*y6 + 2*y7
y4' = y5 + 2*y6 + 12*y7
y5' = 4*y6 + 3*y7
y6' = 6*y7
y7' = 0
The size of the original model is 9
