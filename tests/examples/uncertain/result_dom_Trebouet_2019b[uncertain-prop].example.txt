New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1 + 1/4*S6
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5 + S6
Lumped system:
y0' = (18/5*y1 + 18/5*y2 + 9/10*y3 + 9/5*y4 + 9/10*y5, 22/5*y1 + 22/5*y2 + 11/10*y3 + 11/5*y4 + 11/10*y5)
y1' = (9/10*y2 + 9/10*y3 + 9/10*y4, 11/10*y2 + 11/10*y3 + 11/10*y4)
y2' = (9/10*y3 + 9/10*y4 + 9/10*y5, 11/10*y3 + 11/10*y4 + 11/10*y5)
y3' = (9/10*y4, 11/10*y4)
y4' = (9/10*y5, 11/10*y5)
y5' = (0, 0)
