New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S4 + 3/2*S11
y2 = S6 + -S11
y3 = S7 + S11
y4 = S8 + S11
y5 = S9
y6 = S10 + -1/2*S11
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + y2 + 4*y4 + y5 + y6
y1' = y2 + y4
y2' = y4 + 2*y6
y3' = 2*y4
y4' = y5
y5' = y3 + 2*y6
y6' = 0
The size of the original model is 12
The size of the reduced model is 7
