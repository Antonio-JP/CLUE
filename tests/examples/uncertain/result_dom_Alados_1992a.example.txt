New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = 11*y1 + 9*y2 + 7*y3 + 13*y4 + 21*y5 + 9*y6
y1' = 4*y0 + 24*y2 + 43*y3 + 6*y4 + 18*y5 + 4*y6
y2' = 3*y1 + 6*y3 + 9*y4 + 16*y5 + 8*y6
y3' = 2*y1 + y2 + 27*y4 + 9*y5 + 4*y6
y4' = y1 + 7*y2 + 7*y5 + 7*y6
y5' = 7*y0 + y4 + 12*y6
y6' = y4 + y5
The size of the original model is 7
The size of the reduced model is 7
