New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = 48*y1 + 50*y2 + 57*y3 + 64*y4 + 29*y5 + 18*y6
y1' = 27*y2 + 23*y3 + 28*y4 + 18*y5 + 35*y6
y2' = y1 + 47*y3 + 49*y4 + 26*y5 + 23*y6
y3' = y1 + y2 + 35*y4 + 24*y5 + 37*y6
y4' = y1 + 2*y3 + 36*y5 + 90*y6
y5' = y4 + 33*y6
y6' = 0
The size of the original model is 7
