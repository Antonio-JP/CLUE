New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S3 + 188/285*S9
y2 = S4 + 5/19*S9
y3 = S5 + 30/19*S9
y4 = S6 + -31/19*S9
y5 = S7 + 14/19*S9
y6 = S8 + 1/3*S9
Lumped system:
y0' = 5*y1 + y2 + 2*y3 + 2*y4 + 3*y5 + 4*y6
y1' = 3*y2 + 9*y3 + 7*y4 + 6*y5 + 6*y6
y2' = 5*y3 + 3*y4 + 6*y6
y3' = 2*y2 + 2*y4 + y5 + 6*y6
y4' = y2 + y5
y5' = 6*y6
y6' = 0
The size of the original model is 10
