New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S5 + 1/4*S7
y5 = S6
Lumped system:
y0' = (468/5*y1 + 189/10*y2 + 63/5*y3, 572/5*y1 + 231/10*y2 + 77/5*y3)
y1' = (27/10*y0 + 27/10*y2 + 9/10*y3, 33/10*y0 + 33/10*y2 + 11/10*y3)
y2' = (63/10*y0 + 9/10*y3 + 9/5*y5, 77/10*y0 + 11/10*y3 + 11/5*y5)
y3' = (18/5*y4, 22/5*y4)
y4' = (117/40*y2 + 9/8*y3, 143/40*y2 + 11/8*y3)
y5' = (0, 0)
