===============================================
New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + 2*y2 + 2*y4 + 3*y5
y1' = y0 + y3 + 3*y4 + 3*y5
y2' = 2*y4
y3' = y4 + y5
y4' = y2 + 2*y3
y5' = 10*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3 + 3*y4
The size of the original model is 6
The size of the reduced model is 6
