New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S1
y2 = S2
y3 = S3
y4 = S4
y5 = S5
y6 = S6
y7 = S7
Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + 4*y2 + 3*y3 + 3*y4 + 3*y5 + y6
y1' = 2*y2 + y3 + 4*y4 + 2*y5
y2' = 2*y3 + 2*y5 + y6 + 2*y7
y3' = 3*y4 + y5 + 2*y6
y4' = 3*y2 + 2*y5 + y6
y5' = y6 + 3*y7
y6' = y7
y7' = 0
The size of the original model is 8
