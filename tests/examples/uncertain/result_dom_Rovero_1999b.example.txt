Lumped system:
y0' = 3*y1 + y2 + 6*y4 + 3*y5 + y6 + 2*y7 + y8 + y10
y1' = 2*y0 + y4 + 2*y5 + y7 + y8 + 2*y10
y2' = 3*y1 + y4 + 3*y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9 + 2*y10
y3' = 2*y2 + y7 + y8 + y10
y4' = y2 + 2*y5 + y7 + y8 + y10
y5' = 2*y2 + 2*y3 + 3*y9 + 2*y10 + y11
y6' = y7 + y9 + y10
y7' = y2 + 3*y5 + y10
y8' = y5 + y11
