New variables:
y0 = S0
y1 = S6
y2 = S7
y3 = S11
Lumped system:
y0' = (7999/4000*y1 + 7999/4000*y2 + 3999/4000*y3, 8001/4000*y1 + 8001/4000*y2 + 4001/4000*y3)
y1' = (7999/4000*y0 + 7999/4000*y3, 8001/4000*y0 + 8001/4000*y3)
y2' = (7999/4000*y0, 8001/4000*y0)
y3' = (3999/4000*y0 + 7999/4000*y1, 4001/4000*y0 + 8001/4000*y1)
