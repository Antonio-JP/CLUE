Lumped system:
y0' = y1 + y4 + 2*y6 + 5*y10 + y11 + y12
y1' = 3*y2 + 6*y6 + y10 + 2*y12
y2' = y0 + 3*y3 + y5 + 9*y7 + 10*y10 + 2*y11
y3' = y4 + y5 + y7 + y8 + 2*y9 + y10
y4' = 7*y5 + 3*y6 + y7 + y8 + 5*y10
y5' = 5*y6 + y7 + 3*y8 + 5*y10 + y11 + 2*y12
y6' = 4*y3 + 2*y11
y7' = 6*y10 + 4*y11 + y12
y8' = y9 + 2*y10 + y11
y9' = 7*y10 + y11
y10' = y6 + y12
y11' = 3*y1
y12' = 0
