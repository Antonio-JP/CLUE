# Work in the paper:

- Review and comment on what Alexander is doing
- Give it a run to the Rational part
- Think how to incorporate the experiments.

# Work on the code:

- Add the epsilon analysis in the file `numerical_example.py`.
- Add some examples of that in the JSON
- Add all examples that appear on the paper.
- Generate graphs with two different Y-axis on the same picture.

# Work on experiments:

For each of the models we are using:

- Go to BioModels and check with Octave files the following information:
  * Initial conditions are correct
  * Type of measure of time
  * Time horizon for simulation
  * Method for solving IVP.
- Check in the notebook if with this information we can execute it. If not, change solver or time horizon.
- Re-run examples with this new information.
