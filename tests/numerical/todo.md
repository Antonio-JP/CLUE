# Work in the paper:

- [ ] Review and comment on what Alexander is doing
- [ ] Give it a run to the Rational part
- [ ] Think how to incorporate the experiments.

# Work on experiments:

For each of the models we are using:

- [ ] Go to BioModels and check with Octave files the following information:
  * Initial conditions are correct
  * Type of measure of time
  * Time horizon for simulation
  * Method for solving IVP.
- [ ] Check in the notebook if with this information we can execute it. If not, change solver or time horizon.
- [ ] Re-run examples with this new information.
