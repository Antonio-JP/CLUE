## Polynomial Models

This folder contains a sequence of `.ode` files with different models from the [BioModels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) database whose dynamics are of type `polynomial`. The name of each model is either given by the theme of the model or the name in the database.

Below are the references to the original papers for some of the models:
